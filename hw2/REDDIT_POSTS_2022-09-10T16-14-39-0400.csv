sportsbetting,xay4sd,NFL Lions Offense Prop Bet Results vs Eagles Opponents Prop Bet Results,"# Offense vs Opponent Comparison

It is good to know how an offense did on props but how about the opponents defense? Were they good at limiting TEs or WRs?

Here is the Detroit Lions team offensive prop results and how opponents did against the Eagles defense last season.

Take a look at the Eagles passing yards prop. The defense held the opposing quarterback under his prop total 13 times. 

I like using this to see what defenses are weak against. RB, TE, WR. You can't stop them all.

G101SafeHaven,xaod32,"10 Observations Ahead of Opening Day - Per An ""Anonymous"" Source","The season is here.  I had a good start on Week 1 of my fantasy team.  Had the Bills defense -- 7 sacks, 3 INTs.  Ah, my kingdom for that kind of defense.  Anyway, it's here, the fun begins, we have a new regime, tons of reasons to be hopeful for the future even though that future is a tad of a ways off.  I was reading an article (which will not be named here other than by the nom de guerre - The Anonymous) that laid out the author's 10 observations heading into the season.  That inspired me to create my own list of 10; and here they are:

**1.** The honeymoon is ended and now the marriage of Daboll and Joe Schoen begins.  As Sly Stone once wrote *""newlyweds a year ago, but you're still checkin' each other out, yeah, yeah""*

Who is Brian Daboll?   Is he the man who ""made"" Josh Allen and the Bills’ offense?  Or did he just go along for the Allen Ride?  *See*  [Browns](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/browns/) (2009-10), [Dolphins](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/dolphins/) (2011) and [Chiefs](https://theathletic.com/nfl/team/chiefs/) (2012),- those units finished last in the league in scoring twice, second-to-last once and 20th.

Let's guess:  Josh Allen & Stefan Diggs is to Daniel Jones & Kenny Golloday  as success is to \_\_\_\_\_\_?

Of course, Daboll won't be calling the plays; that honor goes to Mike Kafka; oh he of the knee of Andy Reid.  What did he learn?  And does any of it work without Ben MacAdoodle-doo's fantasy QB?

Let's guess:  Patrick Mahomes & Tyreek Hill is to Daniel Jones & Kadarius Toney  as success is to \_\_\_\_\_\_?

Competence is all we are really looking for.  Put up a couple 2-3 scores in Quarters 1-3, when it counts, and keep the game within reach until the 4th Q.  If that occurs, Year 1 should be a rousing success for Daboll & Kafka in terms of building a modern day offense - and then a QB in the '23 draft.

On the other side, Daboll is largely viewed as ""hands-off.""  This is the Wink Martindale Game Show.

We will blitz and blitz and blitz some more.  That should be fun to watch.  But the '21 Ravens defense is the cautionary tale.  Felled by injury the defense dissolved into a burn unit.  Without really knowing, I'm guessing that the injury riddled 2021 Ravens defense was still on par with the unit the Giants are fielding this year, especially opening day with both Thibs and Azeez on the sidelines.

But, we haven't seen it yet so maybe there's a surprise from Wink -- likely in the form of a blitz we've never seen.

Who knows but the honeymoon is decidedly over come 4:25 tomorrow and we'll begin to find out.

**2.** As a thought experiment, imagine what the defense would have looked like if Patrick Graham was still here.  I've already forgotten that he was supposedly Daboll's first choice.  That would mean Logan Ryan and Blake Martinez would still be on the roster.  Who knows how it would have impacted the draft.  But it really does punctuate the suspicion that Daboll owns the offense; but the defense not so much.  That is to say, who could really have wanted the return of the architect of a defense that produced an astounding 100,000 - 0 (points surrendered v. scored) last 2-minutes of football?

**3.** Apparently Wink is the reincarnation of Buddy Ryan personality wise and his schtick only works if the defense is successful.  Supposedly the Ravens booted him the minute their defense faltered, even though injuries, not scheme was the primary culprit.  Allegedly he didn't adjust; but as we've seen for years, what you practice in the summer is what you play in the fall and winter; especially in the modern NFL where no one actually practices in season, and it is hard to change oars amidst raging seas.  I'm still liking Wink and his approach.  I'd rather see a 60 sack season couple with 70 TD passes surrendered by Aaron Robinson and whoever replaces him Week 4, and whoever after that Week 7, Week 11, Week 15, etc.

Death by a thousand cuts; death in the final 2 minutes of every half, was simply too painful to watch. Have a little fun.  Make stuff happen or go down in flames trying.  I'm ready for it.

[**4. Injuries, injuries, injuries.**  No](https://4.No) Azeez or Kayvan Week 1.  No Beavers all season. Bummer!  Those three guys were the number 1 thing I wanted to watch this season; KT & Azeez are still my principal reason for thinking there might be fun things still to see this year, if not tomorrow.   If those 2 guys can produce 10-ish sacks apiece and play the run well, we are on our way defensively.  This Sunday will not be one of those days to watch.  Instead we get to watch the X-Man get XX'ed out like he always has been to date.  Maybe they activate Roche for this game - I think they do - remember, teams get to add 2 PS players every game.  Maybe my boy, Mr. Tomon (LLT or LTL if you like) gets real playing time and rises to the occasion.  But whoever is playing, King Henry will welcome them to the NFL!  (LLT = Little Lawrence Taylor; LTL = Lawrence Taylor Light)

Amazingly, Sterling Shephard looks like he'll play; he was not on the injury report at all.  So will Toney and Golloday.  I guess we really should be running an over-under pool as to which game, which series, which play, which player, results in the first injury.  As a parlay, we can bet on whether any of the 3 make it out of Week 1!

Dane Belton is listed as questionable compared to Thibs' and Azeez's doubtful.  Still he likely isn't playing.  Jeffereson should get elevated along with Roche.

And finally is it Brederson or Ezeudu at LG?  I'm hoping Daboll believes Ezeudu is the right guy.  I don't hate Brederson, but Ezeudu packs more promise at the moment and, should he prove capable, the O-Line is then 3/5ths of the way there.

**5.** Inside Linebacker looks like a colossal hole right now.  Dumping Martinez a week prior to facing The King says I don't know what,  but the combo of Calitro and Crowder is pretty scary, at least in my eyes.

At least McFadden should get some good reps; and though I am only talking to myself, and perhaps stupidly so, I am hoping because of his size (6' 3""/260 lbs) and his induction into the G101HoF, Mr. Tomon (LLT or LTL if you prefer) gets a shot on the inside.  Who wants to watch Crowder and Calitro?  I mean, really? Who?

**6.** W-L Success?  Really, we should hope we lose as many games as it takes to get the number 1 overall pick; or at least a top 5.  We need our QB of the future and between Young, Stroud, Levis and Richardson, there will be someone worth taking and available that early.  Putting aside the '23 draft, and looking just at the schedule with the philosophy that the goal is to actually win games, the first 4 weeks give us 2 teams we should lose to under all circumstances (Tennessee & Dallas) and two who we should have a 50/50 shot at beating (Carolina/Chicago).  After those 4, GB, Baltimore (2 L's), then the easiest 4 game stretch in memory - Jaguars (Away), Seahawks (Away), Texans (Home), Lions (Home).  That's 4 very possible W's.  One could actually see this team at 6-4 after 10 games.  That would mean already Schoen and Daboll have constructed a functional team despite having no QB, a young and developing O-Line, a completely unreliable WR unit, and Aaron Robinson.  5-5 would be also more successful than not.  4-6, 3-7, not so much - still a bottom feeder.  Less than that and we'll be looking for other reasons to believe.  And the married couple may have their first fight (to continue the metaphor)

**7.** [O](https://theathletic.com/3560682/2022/09/02/giants-gm-joe-schoen-managing-expectations-entering-first-season-of-rebuild/)f course Schoen has already announced his personal belief that this year's roster still sucks.  The sheer number of waiver wire claims and PS players who were not with the team all summer tells us that.  So 6-4 feels more dreamy than 2-8 through the first 10.

**8.** No list of preseason observations is complete without at least one more ""fuck you, Dave Gettleman"" comment.  The Last Resort happened this week so we could have enough money to make it through the season.  Now Lenny costs us 30M next season against the cap.  Remember all that supposed cap space in '23?  Bye-bye!  Ah well, at least Lenny is a solid player if not the 4th best in the league (where his dollars say he should be).  And while talking cap space, I have to say I am now really pulling for Darius Slayton.  The more I listen to him talk, the more I like him - he comes off as sincere, mature, clear-eyed, and team-oriented.  If only he could catch.

&#x200B;

**9.** As I said above, '22 is it for Daniel Jones.  I'd actually go further than that and suggest that the whole ""give him a chance"" mantra is a charade.  Between not picking up his 5th year option, the recent reporting that the Giants were seriously interested in Russell Wilson, and Schoen's fall travel schedule, not to mention the debilitating economic impact of trying to rebuild with a 5th year QB who has to be paid far more than any rookie, and the writing is literally on the wall.  Kentucky v. Florida tonight - where is Joe Schoen?

**10. Finally -Prediction:**  No one thinks we can win tomorrow.  Indeed, when people put there prediction into points, we lose by 2 scores plus.  I think that's right.  Whether we lose by 14 or 28, we should get dominated badly by Tennesse's offense.  The only thing that may keep the game close is Tennessee's preference for running before passing and what that can do to the clock.  If we can hold King Henry to 7 yards per rush without surrendering any home run runs, then the clock will be the Giant's best ally in keeping the score, if not the actual game, close.  The only way the game goes differently is if one or more of Wink's crazy blitzes produces run-scoring turnovers.  Without Thibs and Azeez that seems unlikely.

Offensively it is hard to imagine more than 2 maybe 3 scoring drives.  Other than Wan'Dale, none of the receivers practiced again all summer.  I guess you could argue that Golloday ""practiced""; but really, do we think it fair to call it that?  The O-Line is of course a work in progress and they are going to face one of the league's better defenses, even without Landry.  Simmons is going to be a real handful for the interior and that likely will make Daniel's day fraught.  My guess is 38-13, with 2 red zone FGs as opposed to TDs.

not sure what to think of yesterday because 2 out of 3 scam bets hit as well, usually it is either one or the other

and now they shifted the lines straight back down with tons of scam bets again (these shifts make absolutely no sense), i'll probably either sit today out or look for line movements again to see what people are betting on

**SCAM INDICATOR (EXTREMELY HIGH SCAM LEVEL):**

*a list of people and whatever crews they're in definitely being involved in the fixing, in the order where ""shane livensparger"" has the most fixed matches (showing up almost EIGHT times more often in these scam bets than would be expected under a normal distribution):*

**'adam hamari', 'alan porter', 'chad whitson', 'larry vanover', 'nic lentz', 'paul emmel', 'vic carapazza', 'will little', 'doug eddings', 'james hoye', 'jordan baker', 'tripp gibson', 'adam beck', 'adrian johnson', 'angel hernandez', 'bruce dreckman', 'erich bacchus', 'lance barksdale', 'marvin hudson', 'nestor ceja', 'roberto ortiz', 'ryan blakney', 'nick mahrley', 'bill miller', 'brian knight', 'jeremy riggs', 'shane livensparger'**

*if i was in a mlb team and knew this was going on i would be pissed beyond belief because it completely destroys the natural flow of the game, but i can feel for the umpires because they might get replaced by robots in two years and there is probably a lot of bad blood between them and the MLB but that still doesn't excuse any of this by a long shot.*

**+38.04** over 364 bets:

I think the proper way of abusing this is to either actually watch these matches live and look for weird behavior in the umpires or to find out where the most money is at in public bets and then taking the opposite side... with my way of doing it it looks like i can get something between a 40-50% chance of picking fixed matches but i think with the proper way it might be possible to get up to 70%

BettingPicks,xaa99w,Week 2 NCAAF,"

Hail  People,

if I have time I will post my record, betting account is up 581 for the month - but that could include a couple of soccer bets. 

Just gonna throw these out there and maybe a couple of thoughts because I have to road trip to Philoly tomorrow for a concert (waiting until after the Alabama game, I don't care what my co-pilots say):

I am skipping Friday night - I just got done with a 60 hour week over 4 days, can't see straight, but I would lean towards the Over, probably UCF as long as it stays at 6 or less (at my book its -6)

Kansas St -7 vs Mizzou 333/300 - a pick against an SEC team out of conference? Well, I still don't REALLY think of Mizzzou as an SEC team, I like the K-State program since the 1st Bill Snyder  era, they are at home, it'd be a big/local scalp for them and there is a chane they get GOOD Adrian as opposed to BAD Adrian. As an SEC homer, I wasnt happy making this but since I am taking a couple of ladies to Salem, Mass next weekend for an early Halloween weekend, I'd like to have more money than less.

Bama -20 @ Texas 448/400. Homer bet, you bet. As long as it wasw under 21 - it was worth this kind of money early in the season (usually a mistake).  I think Latu comes back, Bryce plays longer and builds a nice relationship with all the new kids at WR, Gibbs gets more Saban lost to a couple of assistants last season, someone must pay. He won't feel too bad about running it up on Sark because of all the resources TX has available and they are out of conference and the only big name on this years out of conference game. ROLL TIDE

Vandy +13 330/300 and ML 100/360 - OK these teams are not THAT far apart to justify this kind of ML, I think Vandy may win (SEC homer, but also the small bet), but I predict they cover at worst.

C. Mich -5 vs S. Alabama 220/200  High scoring game, some of my lean comes from reading . Hate to favor the MAC over the Sun Belt/CUSA but with MACtion, you never know what you are going toget, it won't be defense, should have take the over :)

MD -26.5 over Charlotte 330/300 - Fear The Turtle - hey, it's under 27

Colorado +17.5 @ Air Force 220/200 - OK, former season ticket holder for both schools, altitude wont be a factor, CU lost most of the guys that were any good to tansfer, but they still have better recruits than the Zoomies (note, not necessarily better players/teammates) - this is just because 17.5 is too big a difference for a team that should be bigger, faster, etc. The 90 minute road trip won't be a factor. Figures they'd after this game after I moved out east. I think the option would have been more effective with colder weather. Wish both teams well, but odds are only AFA goes bowling.

Auburn -24 vs SJ St - 330/300 - this is NOT a SEC homer bet, it;'s a long ass trip for SJSt to collect a check. If I am playing, I enjoy the atmosphere and try not to get hurt before our own conference season starts. Auburn is being doubted everywhere, everone thinks they'll have a crap season. They need to prove they are still the 2nd best team in the state.

Miss St -11 @ AZ - 315/300. This one IS an SEC homer bet. Also, Leach is going to want to light up a former rival, and AZ sucks, bad. 

Good Luck all, I may end up with a few NFL games, but if so they'll be sunday monrning, assuming we dont end up in Philly on Sunday, not a fan of my book as a phone app, I seem to get screwed on some bets. I do know I am already all over Broncos over Seattle, think I have the Vikes....

Good Luck all, win big

BettingPicks,xa8tcj,NFL Week 2 - Matchup of the Week Poll,"

We are always looking to bring our community the best betting information and analysis in the industry. One way we’re looking to do this is by bringing more perspectives into the  Forum. This NFL season we will be hosting a thread each week in the NFL Betting Forum where one of our sports betting analysts will break down a game for everyone. The best part of this will be the open ended communication that is encouraged to take place from community members. This is your chance to ask our analysts 'how', 'why', 'what' and 'to describe' anything in their analysis. What makes it more valuable is you and the rest of the  community will get to vote one the matchup of the week.

 

Some other notables:

Weekly polls will open on Fridays for the following week’s matchups.

Weekly polls will close Sunday’s after the primetime game.

 analysts will be following most games but not every game. We have freelancers who follow these other games who, unfortunately, won’t be able to host forum threads.

Thursday games will not be available to choose from. We want to give our analysts at most a week’s notice and since the poll will be posted on Friday’s this doesn’t work out.

 

We're really excited about this event and we hope it will provide you some valuable information each week. ",Tacos4Life132,https://www.reddit.com/r/BettingPicks/comments/xa8tcj/nfl_week_2_matchup_of_the_week_poll/,/r/BettingPicks/comments/xa8tcj/nfl_week_2_matchup_of_the_week_poll/,0,2022-09-09 22:42:31,1,,False,1.0,NFL,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

XSportsbook,xa8bni,53 NFL Same Game Parlay & Prop Bets for Sunday 9-11-2022,"# NFL Same Game Parlay & Prop Bets

I went 4-1 on the Thursday Night game between the Rams & Bills.

3 and 0 on player props. I was right on the Bills -2.5 but wrong on the over.

Still, 4 and 1 to start the season is good.

Yes, 53 bets for Sunday. I bet in large volume because prop bets are correlation bets. This means I am not going to get them all right but I can grind away and make money.

sportsgambling,xa6au9,Free Sports Gambling Newsletter (Week 1 Trend),"For the last 2 years, I have published a free weekly sports gambling newsletter that aggregates data, trends, and insights in the sports gambling industry.   


We compile this into a quick read every Thursday morning to help you become a better bettor.   


**Here is one trend we found for week 1 of NFL:**   
*Teams that failed to reach the Playoffs in the previous season, who are underdogs on the road in Week 1, have a record against the spread of 73-46-1 all time*. If you were to bet $10 on each of those games, that would bring you a **profit of $2,348**.

**Here are the games this week that fall under that trend:**

•New York Giants (+6.5) at Tennessee Titans

•Jacksonville Jaguars (+4) at Washington Commanders

•Cleveland Browns (+2.5) at Carolina Panthers

eagles,xa5mip,Game Preview Week 1 Philadelphia Eagles (0-0) at Detroit Lions (0-0),"**Philadelphia Eagles (0-0) at the Detroit Lions (0-0)**|
:-:|
The 2022 Philadelphia Eagles season is the franchise's 90th season in the National Football League. The team is looking to continue to grow under second year coach Nick Sirianni who led the team to the playoffs in his first season. One player in particular the Eagles hope continues to improve under Sirianni is 3rd year QB Jalen Hurts, who needs to improve his passing game to take the Eagles to the next level. The Eagles made sure to give Hurts the weapons needed to make that next step adding Pro Bowl WR AJ Brown from the Titans in a draft day trade to give the Eagles a #1 WR to pair with their first round pick from last year, DeVonta Smith. The Eagles also added a face familiar to Sirianni bringing in former Colts slot WR Zach Pascal. Hurts has the tools to make the leap, now it will be up to him to make it. On defense is where the Eagles really revamped the team adding first round DT Jordan Davis along with his Georgia teammate LB Nakobe Dean to mix along with veterans Hassan Reddick, James Bradberry, Kyzir White and CJ Gardner-Johnson. The Eagles will also return veteran Brandon Graham who missed 15 games last season with an achilles injury. DC Jonathan Gannon’s first test will be against the Detroit Lions who made some upgrades of their own adding WR DJ Chark to the mix, as well as first round WR Jameson Williams. Luckily the Eagles will not see the speedy WR from Alabama in Williams, who is still recovering from his ACL tear during his senior season. Still even without Williams, the Lions have a nice set of skill players with Swift, Chark, Hockenson and St. Brown. St Brown will look to build off last season where he had the most catches without a drop and was one of the best receivers down the stretch for the Lions. The Eagles defense will have their hands full, but if they can play as good as they look on paper they should be able to shut down the Lions offense and force Goff into mistakes especially with the Lions weakness at guard after losing Big V to injury. On offense the Eagles need to get the run game going to slow down the Lions talented edge rushers which features first round pick Adrian Hutchinson and Charles Harris. The Eagles OL needs to hold off the ends and attack up the middle where the Lions defense is its weakest to get the run game going and work in some play-action for some big plays. Looking forward to kicking off the season with a win. Go Birds!|

The Eagles offense finally started to click and got the run game going, as Boston Scott and Jordan Howard made the most of Miles Sanders being out. Both RBs had 12 carries each and combined for 117 yards rushing combined on the ground.Scott broke a scoreless tie late in the first period with a 1-yard run and Howard's 4-yard run late in the second quarter put Philadelphia up 17-0. They each had a short touchdown run in the third quarter. The Eagles defense was also clicking, sacking Goff 5 times and returning a Swift fumble for a touchdown in route to their most lopsided win on the road since beating the St. Louis Cardinals by 42 points nearly 40 years ago.|

**General**|
:---|
**Referee**: Tony Corrente|
During the 2021 campaign, first-year head coach Nick Sirianni guided Philadelphia to a 9-8 record and trip to the playoffs. It was among the largest year-over-year win total improvements in Eagles history.|
Sirianni became the third Eagles head coach to advance to the playoffs in their first year with the team (Chip Kelly in 2013, Ray Rhodes in 1995). He also became the second rookie head coach in NFL history to finish with a winning record and postseason berth after starting 2-5 or worse through seven games, joining Frank Reich (Colts, 2018).|
Since Jeffrey Lurie’s first full year of ownership in 1995, Philadelphia has the 5th-most playoff appearances (16) in the NFL, behind New England (21), Green Bay (20), Indianapolis (18) and Pittsburgh (17). All five of Lurie’s hires (all first-time head coaches) have made the postseason within their first two years – Sirianni (2021), Doug Pederson (2017),  Chip Kelly (2013), Andy Reid (2000) and Ray Rhodes (1995-96).|
Dating back to the 2017 campaign, only seven NFL clubs have made at least four playoff appearances: Philadelphia, Buffalo, Kansas City (five), L.A. Rams, New England, New Orleans and Tennessee.|
In the all-time series vs. Detroit, Philadelphia owns an 18-16-2 record with an 8-6-2 mark on the road (3-2 at Ford Field). The long-standing series dates back to the Eagles’ inaugural 1933 campaign.|
Philadelphia last faced the Lions in Week 8 of 2021, resulting in a 44-6 road victory that helped springboard a 7-2 run over the team’s next nine games to ultimately secure a spot in the NFC playoff picture.|
In that contest, the Eagles rushed for a season-high 4 TDs, including a pair by Boston Scott. Former Lion Darius Slay also returned a fumble forced by Detroit native Avonte Maddox 33 yards for a score.|
Philadelphia has produced the most season-opening victories in the NFL since 2011, capturing 9 of its last 11 kickoff weekend matchups (including a 5-1 record in Week 1 games since 2016). In that span, the Eagles are one of five teams with 8+ wins in season openers, joining Denver, Kansas City, New England and San Francisco (all 8-3).|
On Sunday, Philadelphia will open its season on the road for the third consecutive year. Most recently, the Eagles defeated Atlanta, 32-6, in the 2021 season opener, which signaled the largest victory margin by a new Eagles head coach on kickoff weekend in the Super Bowl era. Philadelphia is 6-2 in Week 1 away games since 2009.|

**The More You Know**|
 :---|
**Pride & Prejudice**|
If like me, you watched this season of Hard Knocks: the Detroit Lions, you probably surmised that Lions’ head coach Dan Campbell is all about them grits. A southern boy born in central Texas, Campbell surely was raised on Gulf of Mexico shrimp ‘n grits. I reckon his blood is grainy with grits.It’s no surprise coach Campbell had grits on his mind when he was brainstorming this Lions team’s identity. Look, yes the city of Detroit is an adequate representation of “grit”, but it would be a mistake to think Philadelphia doesn’t one-up them in that department. While the city of Philadelphia brought you [Gritty](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dn591_aXsAE0rvt?format=jpg&name=large) 4 years ago, the Lions’ [Roary the stoned Lion](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/sportsmascots/images/b/b2/Roary.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160219160139) is known for things like [holding records for most popcorn eaten in one sitting, most high fives during a single Lions game, most hugs given during a single Lions game, and most laughs and smiles caused in one year](https://imgur.com/a/O18vZGY). True grit.|

&nbsp;
 
**Matchups to Watch**|
:--|
**Jordan Mailata vs Aiden Hutchinson**|
Aiden Hutchinson will get his welcome to the NFL by facing off against 6’8 Jordan Mailata who despite not playing organized football prior to being drafted in 2018 has emerged as one of the top LTs in the league after last year's break out this season. Hutchinson is a high motor guy who was the projected number one pick in the draft before the Jaguars, in a baffling move selected Tavon Walker, regardless Hutchinson will be a tough matchup for Mailata and put the big man’s athleticism to the test early and often. Mailata should be able to hold his own against the rookie though, he was asked to block the most of any linemen without help last season and largely held his own only allowing 3 sacks. If Mailata wins in the trenches and protects Hurts backside it will help his QB get comfortable early so that he can hit his many weapons downfield which could spell trouble for the Lions.|
**Eagles RBs vs Lions rush defense**|
Last season the Eagles offense ran all over the Lions rushing for 236 yards and 4 rushing TDs in the 44–6 route. The Eagles do not have one of those RBs in Jordan Howard, but the Lions will have to still deal with Scott, Gainwell and Hurts who contributed 158 of those yards and two of those TDs. They will also face a healthy Miles Sanders who missed last year's game with an ankle injury and the newly picked up Trey Sermon. The Eagles will look to repeat that performance powered behind their strong offense line. The Lions are strong on the ends, but weaker in the middle with McNeil and Brookers being average against the run. Look for the Eagles to try to get the rushing game early to keep the Lions ends honest and get the play action set up for Hurts who excels on play action passes.|
**Eagles DTs vs the Lions guards**|
The Lions have a great tackle pair in Penei Sewell and Taylor Decker and have a top 3 center In Frank Ragnow, but they are weak at the guard spots and just got weaker with former Eagles Big V ending up on the IR. To make matters worse Ragnow missed practice Thursday and is questionable to play in the game with a groin injury. Jonah Jackson was a weak spot on the line last year surrendering 35 pressures and 4 sacks. Tommy Kraemer will fill in for Vaitai at right guard. The two will have to face off against one of the strengths of the Eagles defense with their interior pass rush which includes Fletcher Cox, Javon Hargrave and rookie first round pick Jordan Davis. The Eagles have a clear advantage here and need to exploit it. If the Eagles can shut down the run game like they did last year where they held Swift to 27 yards on the ground and the entire Lions to just 57 yards, the Eagles will force the game into Goff’s hands. Hopefully the added pressure can force the former top pick into some mistakes, Goff is generally good at protecting the football, but is known for holding the ball too long and taking sacks which can stall drives and force punts which would pose a good omen for the Eagles.|
**Marcus Epps vs. T.J. Hockenson**|
Epps has been raved about all during camp and claimed the starting safety spot this past offseason after moonlighting in it last season. The Eagles could also choose to line up CJ Gardner Johnson or linebacker Kyzir White on the Lions talented TE, but Epps did match up against him last year. Speaking of last year’s matchup, Epps knocked Hockenson out of the game last year with a hit on the TE on a 3rd down last year and I am sure the big TE will be looking for payback. Despite leaving the game early, Hockenson was still able to pull down 10 receptions for 89 yards last getting open at will, but kept in check in the redzone and out of the endzone. Will be an interesting matchup, look for Goff to use Hockenson as an outlet if the middle of the Lions line doesn’t hold up.|

NFLBETS,x9zzj8,NFL SPREADS BLOG WEEK 1 (0-0),"What's good Reddit. My name is Beau and I am a degenerate sports better. My main vice is NFL football. This blog will be weekly write up of my picks from the week prior, and picks for the week.  I work a very boring job and am just doing this to kill time and maybe entertain people and put people on some locks. I'll try to have this released on Thursdays. I am an alumni of University of Northern Iowa. My allegiances sports wise are the KC Chiefs and the KC Royals due to me living in KC in the past. I was a Chiefs fan when Alex Smith was the QB and was all for the change to Mahomes. Take that for what it's worth, I'll post my Lee Summit High School year book pic if nobody believes me. My podcast favs are: Cowherd, Pardon My Take, Jason Mcintyre Show, The Favorites, and Hammer Dahn/Pat Mcafee show.

The breakdown of the weekly blog will be:

Intro/Main comments

What Hit, What Didn't, and Why?

The picks

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I'm glad I started this blog today because I was all over the Rams last night. I should have known the Bills would be good considering Josh Allen played 2 perfect playoff games and lost because of Mahomes/his defense. I also didn't know Matt Stafford was MAGA republican and only agreed to throw to his white receivers but that's my fault for not doing research.

&#x200B;

The only preseason tickets I have are a Chiefs/Vikings SB ticket and a Chiefs/Eagles. I don't have the Vikings in any of these picks but I love JJettas, Theilan, their RB duo, and their solid defense. Zimmer hated Kirk Cousins, how can you hate on Kirk Cousins? Kirk Cousins is a Ham and Cheese Sandwich, he's chicken noodle soup, he's a good cold Easy Eddy. If you hate him that's on you. Clearly what we saw from the Rams last night is they're not a finished product yet. I don't trust Trey Lance and I hate Tom Brady (Their o-lines falling apart also).

**NOW>>>>>> THE PICKS**

Pittsburgh Steelers @ Cincy Bengals (-114)

**The pick: Steelers +6.5**

Why: There will be some picks that my unmitigated bias does come through. I have other theory's to support this game but I think the Chiefs enabled the Bengals last year. They choked twice. It's a good thing that happened cause the Chiefs will be better for it (more on that later). This is a great ""ra-ra"" spot for Mike Tomlin. He doesn't have losing seasons: from prime ben, old ben, to duck hodges/mason rudolph, he doesn't go below .500. The Bengals made hay while the sun was shining against the ghost of Big Ben and the Ravens backups last year. This isn't a hot take: Mitch Trubitsky/Kenny Pickett are better than Big Ben last year. To quote Shannon Sharpe I think the Steelers get their ""Restitution"" and upset the Bengals, or keep it close. New O-line needs time for the Bengals and Joe Shiesty looks a little out of it due to his appendix surgery in the off season.

Score 24-23 flip a coin, I think Steelers.

Philly Eagles @ Detroit Lions

**The pick: Lions +3.5 (-106)**

Why: but Beau, but Beau, you have the Eagles future? I love the Eagles this year. Their division is trash, it's Dallas with their worst o-line in the Dak era, the Giants with Danny Dimes/Lung Mcgee Tyrod Taylor, and the Washington Football Commanders with Wentz. They win that division easy. I just think this is a perfect spot for Detroit Rock City. Bad teams don't know their bad until week 4-6. The Lions have a capable starter, a good offensive line, a #1 receiver/TE/Back. Their defense could be and issue but I think the Eagles start slow with their new additions and eventually crawl back and win. This is the most 27-24 game of all time. If you want the Lions but don't like the whole game this could be a spot to take 1h.

Score: 27-24 Eagles

Indy Colts @ Houston Texas +7.5 (-120)

**The Pick: Texans +7.5**

This is the Lions reasoning all over again. Bad teams don't know they're bad. Say what you want about Davis Mills and his long ass neck he's solid. Had he stayed another year and Stanford he would have been the first qb taken this year. They have players and they play hard. The Colts have a new qb, that's nothing new for Frank Reict and he's on the list of coaches this year where they've been solid, but it's time to Shit or get off the pot. I understand Andrew Luck retired right before the season, but that was 3 years ago. I heard the news while I was sweating my balls off in a bar in college. I'm 25 with a 401k now so it's now or never Franky. I think this is an ugly game to start and the Texans keep it close to the end.

Score: 26-21 Colts

Baltimore Ravens @ New York Jets

The pick: Ravens -7.5 (-106)

Why: I got this pick right after they announced the Flacco news, but it just came across the wire that a Jets tackle is also out. The Jets with or without Wilson are a bottom 5 team this year. The Ravens are a smart organization. Lamar is not a smart businesss man. He doesn't have an agent. He's made millions of dollars but he's fumbling the bag like i've never seen. I heard on a Podcast that the kicker Justin Tucker has more commercials in Maryland than Lamar does. Where the Ravens are smart here, they said this to Flacco too. Prove it. Prove it year for Lamar. Last time they did this they won the soupy and paid him. Go win us playoff games Lamar. And that's what I think he will do. I might have to grab a Ravens/Chiefs AFC final ticket when the playoffs start if the bracket works out in our favor. The Bengals danced on the Ravens grave last year and I think they come back pissed off. They've always had a solid team. They add the Iowa Center and the Norte Dame safety. I think with Lamar and Mahomes they can throw the ball to anybody. It'll be interesting to see what Hollywood Brown does in Arizona but I don't think that affects Lamar at all. He could be throwing to me and 2 of my buddies and still go for 210 with 80 rushing. Ravens skull fuck the Jets and their old friend Joe ""elite"" Flacco.

Score: 38-17 Ravens (flip that around)

Final Pick: AFTERNOON TEASER

If you're unaware of what teasers are, i'm taking all the afternoon games and teasing them 4.5 points. Which moves the spread in my favor by that much.

New York Giants @ **Tennesee Titans** \-5.5 to -1

**Kansas City Chiefs** @ Arizona Cardinals -5.5 to -1

**Green Bay Packers** @ Minnesota Vikings .1.5 to +3

**Las Vegas Raiders** @ LA Chargers +3.5 to +8

Why: The juice for this one is +333 and the Chiefs line got inflated. I'll start with that game. Ertz/JJ Watt and others are banged up for Arizona. You gotta watch line shifts like this early in the week because they used to be -3.5. Sharps have their guys in each facility to leak news to them. Chiefs roll easy here, how do you plan for a new offense? Andy Reid with 4 new weapons? Andy Reid in September? Don't over think it.

Tennessee lost AJ Brown, they didn't lose Tannehill, Henry, or Vrabel. I think Brian Daboll is a good coach who will look much better next year with Cj Stroud, The Bama kid, or AR15 from Florida. Giants have done nothing to show me theres chance in Gods Green Kingdom they can win this game, or keep it close for that matter.

I think the Packers will have the best defense in the league. Aaron will find Lazard/Doubs/Cobb enough and the 2 headed beast of Dillon/Jones will get them necessary yards and Jones will get a lot of receptions to make up for the loss of Adams. I just don't see the Packers a, losing this game, and certainly losing by 3. This game is 21-20 and once again, flip a coin or bet black on roulette, same odds (not really but still).

I don't think Vegas' defense got any better. I've seen Derrick Carr and Herbert beat the chiefs in arrowhead in 2 different years. One was when Derrick Carr had weapons and threw the ball all over the yard, and Herberts was when the Chiefs gave the ball up 4 times and got fucked by a phantom pass interference. The gap between Derrick Carr and Herbert just simple isn't that big. Carr has his College buddy back and I think they win this game outright, what kind of homefield will the chargers have? and I'll leave you with one more question, if you could pick one OC from last year to develop an actual run game the Raiders, who would you have picked other than Josh Mcdaniels?

Scores:

35-27 Chiefs

28-13 Titans

21-20 Pack

31-30 Vegas

Lets have a weekend, god I love the National Football League.

sportsbetting,x9y5gk,Created an NFL Betting Model,"Hello All,

Over the summer I created a model to attempt to predict NFL scores as best as possible. It was created by using previous years data (weighted by date) and will progressively update throughout the season. It is by no means perfect, but I gave it my best go. I'm not looking for any donations or subscription service, rather to share my journey. The ""Books Spread"" and ""Model TP"" columns data is from DraftKings. Each week I'll use my model (and football knowledge) to make straight bets in the attempt to build a greater bankroll. Thanks for following along!

Third, Mike spent the last week talking about how week 1 is the most unpredictable week and you need to be careful betting it and then Bill makes the same argument about how week 1 is always sloppy and how there is always one crazy game. 4th, Lombardi has been hammering how traveling to hot humid climates this time of year is the most undervalued factor and that Belichick is keeping the Pats in Miami to get acclimated and Bill makes the same point about the weather.

GamblingAddiction,x9m23c,"The fun stopped, but I can’t.","It started off as any other hobby or activity did, just a bit of fun on the weekend and nothing too serious. But Unfortunately I didn’t listen to the common motto of “When the fun stops stop” I kept playing until the Money stopped. 

5 years on from placing my first bet and I’m now banned from all major bookmakers, I’ve had 3 unsuccessful stints with GamStop and a failed attempt at counselling with GamCare it doesn’t seem to matter what I do, gambling is in control now.

I’ve done everything possible to try and combat it, gambling counselling, online blocks, freezing and changing my card details and even downloading anti-gambling software for all my devices. There’s always a way around it and I always find a way to gamble still, despite being heavily in my overdraft.

I just lost another £200 on an NFL game about an hour ago and all I can think of is how to win that money back, I’m down £1000 this week alone and I’m starting to feel like a lost cause. How do I take back control of my life?

BettingPicks,x9e0dn,Really good game to not bet on,"

Which will go completely ignored because everyone is desperate to get a football bet going. But this is probably one of the worst games of the season from a wagering perspective, especially for the side.

 

The champs have been a great play in this spot lately. But, they rarely get a matchup with a contender. And i I cannot remember them ever being a dog since they started putting them on Thursday.

For that reason, the value is with the Rams..but like I said this matchup is one of the toughest they could have came up with, and only for Tre White is still hurt I would really like the Bills here. That, and the fact Buffalo's defense was so prone to late game collapses and the Rams wasn't, especially in the playoffs. These 2 teams 4th quarter defenses were night and day in crunch time and that's why the Rams won the bowl and Buffalo didn't.

However, the Rams, as they did last year, didn't play any starters in preseason at all. Stafford hasn't played a snap since his elbow procedure. I don't see a fast start from them, and since Buffalo could be gashed on the run and the Rams have Akers back, I think they'll be playing posession ball.

But they lost Whitworth and watching the preseason games the offense with the starters will need to be miles better because they didn't taste the end zone hardly at all. The Bills scored more TDs in one half vs the Broncos than the Rams offense did all preseason. Of course that could mean squat but i dunno...

On the Bills side their offensive staff had a lot of guys leave and now Ken Dorsey is calling the plays. There's no guarantee he is as good as last year's model, but they have plenty of weaponry, and they were a better run team last year than the Rams. Though the Rams were better at stuffing the run.

The Bills led the league in 2nd half points last year. If the Rams come out cold as I think they will, it could be hard to catch up and keep pace with Buffalo. I imagine Buffalo's going to put extra emphasis on finishing games, something the Rams D was very effective at.

I think we get a slow 1st half and then a burst of scoring in the 2nd half. Bills will grab a lead and look good but the champs will settle in and it will be a case of does the Buffalo defense collapse again.

I think this has 'down to the last drive' written all over it, which if you watch the NFL lately, this is their M.O. that's why we set a record for OT games last year.

Lean to Buffalo but I think it's a better game to just watch as they will engineer a close game like always to keep the lemmings glued to the actuon til the end. I'm taking 1st half under and full game under and if it's low scoring in the 1st half I'm taking the Over at halftime.

All small bets. My book is doing a special bet Kupp or Davis to score the 1st TD and I let them sucker me into that at +400. Tonight is not a night for steaming into anything, keep it light and fun.

With the Rams lack of play and Stafford elbow, and their O-line tinkering, and the Bills changing staff on offense and both teams changing their no 2 WR options, I think it's too tough to know what each team will look like. I think they're pretty similar talent level wise, line is nailed on.",4Three2day,https://www.reddit.com/r/BettingPicks/comments/x9e0dn/really_good_game_to_not_bet_on/,/r/BettingPicks/comments/x9e0dn/really_good_game_to_not_bet_on/,4,2022-09-08 22:36:01,1,,False,1.0,NFL,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

The NFL has changed with the 2 point conversion and with more modern approaches to strategy decisions.  Have key numbers changed also?

Below is a chart (unfortunately,  1998 technology doesnt let me post a chart without it being a garbled mess so I will type it out and do my best) that shows the full seasons (including playoffs) for 2010 and 2021 (current), and the most common margin of victory:

Margin of victory, Times it happened in that season, percentage of that margin vs all games played that season

# Broncos vs Seahawks Same Game Parlay Picks 9-12-22

**Russel Wilson gets to play against his old team to start his new career in Denver. Is this an advantage for him or for the Seattle defense?**

**Geno Smith gets the start for Seattle and the hope is that he can stay healthy this season. If you look at last years numbers he had a good completion percentage and a TD to int ratio. However, in five games he had only 702 passing yards. Geno does throw underneath a lot and this will come into play on his and his receiver props. I like this game to go under the total and when that happens look for Tyler Lockett to go under on his receptions props. Freddie Swain should also go under on his receiving yards prop. No action on the TE or RB position in this one.**

# NFL Same Game Parlay Picks & Prop Bet Correlations Week 01

**Week one will have several teams with new quarterbacks which is not what I want. I like consistency to make my prop bets. Because of this there will be a few games with limited betting but overall there will be a lot of bets to start the season.**

>***If you didn’t read it here is the*** [***Bills vs Rams Same Game Parlay Picks for Week 1***](https://xsportsbook.com/nfl-betting/buffalo-bills-vs-los-angeles-rams-same-game-parlay-prop-bet-predictions/)

**A quick look at the type of information used to make the prop betting predictions is the passing yards prop bet results below. This is just an overview of one prop. Of course the model breaks down the results to individual players and how the opponent did against each prop is also part of the model.**

**If you are going to make some game totals bets then take a look at the Bills and the Cowboys. Both had a very strong relationship to going over the game total and over on passing yards props. But, if you like the under in the game then both were also good bets to go under the total.**

### Independent Betting Odds vs Correlated Betting Odds

**Because of the correlation between some prop bets and spread or game totals results you will not see the traditional 2.6 win on a two team parlay. An indepth understanding of what type of odds you should be getting on same game parlay bets is available in our article:**

>[***NFL Same Game Parlay & Player Prop Bet Correlations Strategy & Analytics***](https://xsportsbook.com/nfl-betting/nfl-same-game-parlay-player-prop-correlations-strategy-analytics/)

### Quarterback Passing Yards Prop Bet Results

**Below is a pic of how quarterbacks did on just their passing yards prop bets in 2021.**

* **All passing yards prop bet results**
* **Passing yard props results when the quarterbacks team covers the spread**
* **Passing yard prop results when a quarterbacks team does not cover the spread**
* **Passing yard props results when the game goes over the total**
* **Passing yard prop results when the game goes under the total**

**No correlation to spread results but a strong one to game totals results.**

GetSporttrade,x97999,Weekly Market Watch: 9/8/22,"**Biggest Game of the Week:** TB Buccaneers at DAL Cowboys, Sunday, Sep 11, 8:20 pm ET

Both the Bucs and Cowboys open their seasons with question marks surrounding them. Can Brady and TB succeed without Bruce Arians? Will the Cowboys much-maligned offseason cost them a shot to advance forward in a weakened NFC? Our moneyline market on this game sees the Bucs as slight favorites, trading at $53.50. With this being the first Sunday night NFL game of the season, expect some major trading volume in the Sporttrade app!

**Market Movement:** JAC Jaguars at WAS Commanders, Sunday Sep 11, 1:00pm ET

There’s nothing better than placing a trade early in the week and watching the money move in your favor as kickoff approaches. Jacksonville finds itself with a new Head Coach and new vibes entering the season, trading at just $41 to beat the Washington Commanders. People have been selling on Carson Wentz all offseason, while the reports out of Jacksonville have piqued our interest. We’ll be grabbing the Jags early anticipating the price to rise throughout the week (and remember, on Sporttrade, you can sell that [**trade for profit even before the game begins**](https://getsporttrade.com/resources/read-this-and-youll-be-begging-to-trade-in-and-out-of-your-sports-bets/)). 

**Bullish or Bearish:** ALA Crimson Tide at TX Longhorns, Saturday Sept 10, 12:00pm ET

It’s Week 2 of college football and already we have a clash between two of college football’s biggest powerhouses. No. 1-ranked Alabama pays a visit to Texas where Steve Sarkisian’s squad will look to declare that Texas is BACK, for real this time. It’s been a tough decade or so for Texas, so this noon showdown in Austin is a real opportunity for them to shock the CFB world with a win. Are you **bullish** or **bearish** on the Longhorns’ chances vs. Saban and Co.?

**Limit Order Up:** LV Raiders at LA Chargers, Sunday Sept 11, 4:25pm ET

There’s not a more fascinating team entering 2022 than the Los Angeles Chargers. Everyone’s ‘second team’ has seemingly been a playoff dark horse every season since 2000, but appear primed to make a leap this year. At $63.50 to beat the Raiders and $52 to cover -3.5 points, they’ll be in our portfolio. But tread lightly: The Chargers led the NFL in 4th quarter scoring last season (10.6 ppg), but also allowed the most 4th quarter points (10.2). If you don’t want to deal with the volatility, you can utilize Sporttrade’s unique ability to set a limit sell order to lock in a profit and avoid heartbreak. 

**Buy Low, Sell High:** BAL Ravens at NY Jets, Sunday Sept 11, 1:00pm ET

It’s safe to say the market doesn’t think much of the New York Jets’ chances against former MVP Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. NYJ is trading at just $27 to win outright, despite being at home. Such a depressed price for a home team offers a chance to jump in low and sell your position if the Jets happen to get off to a hot start, which can sometimes happen during emotional home openers. After trading out of NYJ, you can then buy into BAL and hold for the remainder of the game, since let’s be real, the Jets are probably not winning this one. ",sporttrade,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSporttrade/comments/x97999/weekly_market_watch_9822/,/r/GetSporttrade/comments/x97999/weekly_market_watch_9822/,1,2022-09-08 17:56:14,1,,False,1.0,None,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

## The Merge is almost here.

The ‘Bellatrix’ update, which is the last major upgrade before Ethereum moves from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), has begun. The purpose of this upgrade is to ensure validators are producing updated Beacon Chain blocks ahead of The Merge. Currently, the Ethereum mainnet (PoW Chain) and the Beacon Chain (PoS Chain) operate in parallel to one another. Although the Bellatrix upgrade doesn’t represent the entirety of The Merge, it is the beginning of the two-part process.

In preparation for The Merge, there is now a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for **ETH**, **USDT,** and **DACXI** on our platform. The service will be available again post-testing, within 48 hours of The Merge’s projected completion date of around September 14th.

For everything you need to know about The Merge, read our last [blog](https://dacxi-7fc1a99e7f23.intercom-mail.com/via/e?ob=wVkRap7qXj9xrfWheBDywU3TOpovgUBBtfrZrpIpxDeWR41qq%2FCIKIV1%2FDboXpx5f6NVevfLE8k7BYmnzKp4LFjyZUBuhTQJV4M0CNOjmCLJN%2BQLzQaZzvUh549zn65feiSbrlzT60ipc6dUQhg5Y4Eocu%2ByNn4sxMJLYFGlc%2BkbxYmQw%2FIWPHXsvBBdw7%2BVTZE0gErHy4tK4%2BWvP%2FSBBTmVlRd9SZMrjpNUxXQwFeIDVxi%2FNUVFvZY10x4Pl2jMn6u5uHu79ZyCpbSi3ZUkyBpRl8S6JtsCQ2GHVjk9wMQ%3D&h=f94c32c5cd3a017edb4cf8947080a23cb518f2e1-kiphrm0y_90737301975725&l=483f914e9dddba875db3920ba32c995e98e18873-17593877).

# Bitcoin update

Early in the week in the presence of lighter selling pressure, Bitcoin pushed higher, reaching weekly highs above $20,500, but then reverted to $19,660 — which was the top of the 2017 bull run — and is acting as firm downside support in 2022. Bitcoin closed at $20,007, returning 2.23% week on week.

# News from the wide world of crypto

Subsequent to the numerous DeFi attacks in 2022, resulting in investors losing billions of dollars, the FBI has requested that DeFi platforms increase their security measures. Likewise, the bureau warned investors against the potential for vulnerabilities in these platforms. The FBI specified that individuals should first conduct thorough due diligence when using DeFi platforms. Investors were also warned to utilize protocols that have been audited by reputable firms and in existence for a long time.

Meta has integrated Ethereum, Polygon and Flow NFT cross-posting for Facebook and Instagram, as part of its push for interoperability. Event organizers using Ticketmaster will now be able to issue tickets as NFTs on the Flow blockchain. Although Ticketmaster originally partnered with Polygon to create NFT tickets for NFL games, the team reelected Flow for this purpose early this year. Beyond issuing NFT tickets, organizers will be able to include unique features including special experiences, celebrity meetups and memorabilia. Furthermore, Ticketmaster is seeking to increase liquidity for tickets through an NFT ticket marketplace enabling these digital assets to be traded in a peer-to-peer manner.

LOADWeeklyArticles,x92nyw,2022 Week 1 Preview - Solden,"Well, Well, Well gentlemen another year, another rocky start to the draft where the LOAD bully Chad finds a way to cause drama 48 hours before the draft, 24 hours before the draft, and quite literally 120 seconds before the draft logging in and trying to change his keeper. I am extremely happy to have football back and spend Thursday, Saturday (confirmed bucknut), Sunday (sad browns fan) and back around for Monday drinking beers, eating shitty food, and nursing hangovers watching this glorious sport and furiously typing in the GroupMe. Fantasy football, prop bets, Dom trade requests, and a ridiculous amount of draftkings contests. Life is good. Bennett has a PSL in his hand 91% of the time. Doug had Ray draft for him again. Tony’s mad at Chad. Paul’s biological clock is off 4 hours still. Sam is wishing me happy birthday a full day early? Casey played 36 holes in a day out of spite. Jon follows up his hungover punishment with a drunk draft. Shawn acted like he was going to draft all Steelers again and got .5 (Mitchell’s not worth a full body count). Dom owns 75% of the Sleeper notifications with prop bets. Jared’s quite literally morphed into his Royal Rumble wrestler. Chad’s creative juices named the entire league (other than tj of course). And Malik’s still soaking wet outside in the rain dejectedly looking through the window wishing he was apart of this bad boy. I must say, those rankings were 1,000% more creative than I was expecting and I still wake up each day wishing I could live one day inside that man’s mind. 

Before I kick this full-on roast session off just wanted to say I love each and every one of you and appreciate us all being able to continue this year after year. As much as we talk shit to each other, the LOAD keeps us close and is a ton of fun for 5? months of the year. Life keeps coming at us faster than we want but having a group of friends like this makes the hard times easier and the good times even better. With that, cheers to this big hot family we’ve created that continues to grow. 

&#x200B;

“Waffle Boi” (Jon) 0-0 vs. “Check that trade I just sent you” (Dom) 0-0

I’m sure Jon is shaking in his boots as Dom continues to hold out on putting a kicker in this lineup. More false sense of security than a hungover Jon showing up to his last place punishment and hating waffles. He carried that same strategy into the draft with 2 starters on the Washington Commanders and a possible hold out at QB with the OG IBS boi in Baltimore. BUT I can’t be too mean with a little one on the way, congrats on the sex by the way. Dom’s drafting skills continue to impress and he’s put himself a solid team together with even better nicknames. Excited to see who of the crew you offer me that’s a totally fair trade where I need depth so 2 of your players for one of my significantly better players makes sense for everyone. Still will never forget my Antonio Gibson trade where you referred to him as a “refrigerator”. You’re gonna need every bit of your BMI to pull this one out or just make sure your BAC is so high it doesn’t matter anyways. 

Jon > DommySalami

&#x200B;

“International LOAD Advocate” (Doug) 0-0 vs. “I’m just gonna draft the same team from last year” (Jared) 0-0

Doug kicks off another year with an absentee ballot and Ray drafting his team – finally with a legitimate excuse on his honeymoon. Rumor has it, Douglas was captured on Rachel’s insta story telling his new international friends about the LOAD so he has now become our Global Ambassador. Based off your high level of activity in the groupme and stellar attendance to all LOAD events I know you won’t let us down. I’ll send you a roster of LOAD members in case you forgot any of our names. Ray drafted yet another decent team that will probably land you in the playoffs with MVP favorite Josh Allen and work horse backs Mixon and Fournette. Ray may not be allowed back to the draft after selecting DeShaun Watson who’s suspended for all but 5 weeks of the fantasy regular season. It’s a bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it pays off. Also Kittle starting off the season hot with a groin injury probably keeping him out of week one – might want to keep some eyes on that. Jared sticking to what he knows with Herbert/Ekeler plus a Dolphins receiver. He went skimpier on running backs than his pups latest haircut and decided to hop on the Miles Sanders experience this year. That ride needs to be retired faster than the top thrill dragster. But as a former champion you have to respect the strategy even though I may not understand it. “oH iM gOnNa ToRcH yOu So BaD iN tHe ChAmPiOnS lOuNgE”

Jerry > Doug

&#x200B;

“Gardner Minshew fanboy” (Tony) 0-0 vs. “This is nothing like my 900 mock drafts” (Pauly) 0-0

Tony went silent but deadly draft strategy putting together a solid squad. Although lot of eggs in the basket of the Giants, Steelers, and Raiders and I don’t think all those puppies scramble. I know you’re probably reading this from the golf course or at minimum in golf attire (always gotta stay ready) but with Patty Mahomes leading the charge and with as much weight as a preseason week 1 preview carries you should be set for a good year. And to answer your week 6 question if it all falls apart, no you still cannot be commissioner only even though you dominate the commish role. Paul the Puppeteer is trying to pull more strings than Chad’s pulled off of 4s, 5s, and 6s by engaging in trade talks immediately. I’m talking draft night 4 trade requests out there where one anonymous owners response to the request was “don’t hold your breathe”. A last minute keeper change (past the deadline? Before the deadline? No one knows) to Aaron Jones completed switched up his draft strategy but he still pulled together a nice squad. Are you sure that’s your starting lineup though? I mean idk I guess that’s what I would do….Tinker away my friend it won’t matter this week. 

Tony > Pauly

&#x200B;

“Blows the draft every year” Solden 0-0 vs. “Hits his white man draft quota every year” Bennett 0-0

A matchup of the two oldest and wisest friends to kick this season off. I did everyone a favor after being repeatedly accused of my keeper ruining everything so I botched the rest of my draft. You’re welcome. With my luck so far this year (torn achilles chasing my dog in the backyard #athlete) I’ll be seeing one of these injuries on my roster anyways. Bennett with a surprisingly solid draft that he will get super defensive about but I respect the thought process of drafting 2 QB’s that were in the super bowl last year carrying you to the LOAD Championship. His plan of not drafting OSU players went as well as our plans for Cedar Point and he ended up with 3 (yes Burrow counts). Confirmed bucknut. This should be enough to keep him out of waffle contention and maybe even awake during the Sunday and Monday night games. Death, Taxes, Bennett immediately falling asleep in his chair when he sits down. In the latest case he was event late to his own bday celebration. The battle of the Matt’s, the battle of the two biggest friends (sorry casey). This one’s for waking me up at 5am every morning with that loud ass truck Junior year. You’re going down. 

Soldy > Snowman

&#x200B;

“Did we establish if you’re trying this year?” (Chadley) 0-0 vs. “Fear of decks and bean bag chairs” (Casey) 0-0

I think we all know there’s some give and take when it comes to making Chad happy. We make the change to Sleeper but we keep kickers. We go progressive adding keepers but regret it when we see the layout. We give him an annual platform to address these changes he schedules a trip of a lifetime to go end some marriages. He’s even somehow lost Paul in this process. Through all this turmoil and adversity he still finds a way to lock in and draft a good team. Is Kirk an MVP this year or is Jameis? Will Kamara take it up the ass from the long hard black dildo that is Lord Commander Commissioner Goodell mid-season? Did Dom and Chad negotiate a behind the scenes agreement so he could draft Deebo? A lot of questions, but if there’s one thing our Chadley has it’s answers. Unfortunately, I don’t see an undefeated start in the cards as he goes to request a song at the DJ table and it’s none other DJ Cholly who responds with a cool “nah man, wait till you hear the beat drop on this one”. With a completely blind approach to the draft asking last minute questions like “wait, what platform are we using?” and “Davante Adams is on the Raiders now?” he pulls off another miracle draft. Much like his shaping of the future Sales leaders at Cintas he’s ready for Cooper Kupp to lead the charge again behind the strongest receiving core I may have ever seen. With a big showing tonight from his RB1, WR1, AND Defense1 I think it carries him into the weekend and ends with a dub. 

Cholly > Chadley

&#x200B;

But wait….could there be? From the absolute top of the rafters none other than Paul Alex aka Pauly D aka Pauly Diesel aka HotTubHandy aka GreekGod aka MockMastaFlex comes out of nowhere with a New York Times Best Seller level borderline Pulitzer Award worthy story of the matchup of the week: SleepySam vs. BigDaddyShawn

**It’s Just Fantasy**

Birds are chirping, sun is slipping through the blinds, and Sam’s alarm starts to sound.. Slap!! His finger hits the stop button. “Yes! New record” he whispers stopping the clock after only .78 seconds. 

It’s Thursday morning, September 8th. This is it, NFL football is back. It’s the first day of the rest of his fantasy season. Confidence is at its week one peak. Why shouldn’t it be? He’s a five time champion looking to add to his resume. 

He jumps out of bed ready to start his day. Ashley rolls over to catch some more sleep. The last two nights keeping her up with questions about his lineup and stories from the draft.

He makes his coffee, already tinkering. Taking one last look at CMC, “rats” with a soft fist to the counter top. Really wanted him, but no matter. I’ve won with Henry before and I’ll do it again he tells himself. There’s nothing standing in his way this year, who could pose a threat to such a dedicated manager like himself? Solden’s year? Nahh, Chads injury luck changing? No way! Surely Shawn couldn’t luck into back to back titles… right? He opens back up the app checking his matchup, Shawn’s team staring back at him looking better than the last time he checked. “It’s just fantasy” he laughs, closing the app. 

46 Miles east, Shawn hits snooze for the second time. Man is being a dad tiring. Christian has been up all night with a tummy ache, poor fella! He’s still adjusting to his new home. At least there’s NFL on tonight, even tho I haven’t had a chance to look at my roster in days, he sighs. 

The draft was only two days ago but it feels like weeks. Did I draft George Pickens? What Steelers do I have have this year? He shutters at the thought of Mitch dropping back. Could be a long season. But it’s just fantasy right? 

Rolling out of bed, he starts his day. Brewing his coffee, wondering what the season has in store.  Looking out his back window, admiring his new pool he thinks, life has been good. Why shouldn’t it be? He’s the reigning fantasy champion after all.. Shawn opens up the app for the first time in days. “Whoops” with a giggle as he sees the Browns and Bengals players on his team. Better check his matchup, who am I even playing he wonders. 

Seeing his roster makes him smile, “maybe daddy could run it back huh buddy?” He jokes to his son. This team is even better than last year he thinks to himself, starting to gain hope. Why not him? 

By the time Sam is out the door and on his way to work, he’s overthinking every move. Coffee left behind in its mug, mismatched socks on his feet, he feels the stress and the weight that comes with the ever growing target on his back. Was that Paul I just drove by? Could he be helping Shawn? Stop psyching yourself he smiles. “it’s just fantasy”. 

It will be hours of anticipation, endless checking of his roster that never changes and a growing sense of hate for Shawn. Every champion is just a thief that stole what’s his, his precious, his glory. Shawn is just the most recent unlucky victim he wants to crush. Shit, better text the group.. “Good luck Shawn” he texts behind eyes filled with darkness. Shawn hasn’t moved to Chardon, he’s moved to fantasy hell. 

This man would sell his soul to win another championship, and this year, he might have already made the sale.

Shawn’s work day starts to drag on, he’s checked his lineup more than his emails at this point. “I can do this” he whispers for the sixth time today. “Daddy’s a champion”  as he touches the picture of his family on his desk. His confidence has been growing with each meeting. What’s there to be afraid of, it’s just the week one nerves that will set the tone for his whole season.. it’s just Sam right?… it’s just fantasy.

Shawn’s body heat raises another degree. Sams washed.  I’m the new king, thumping his chest. Why shouldn’t I be? What’s the difference between him and I? It’s my right, my turn to be a dynasty, my… destiny. “You too bud!” He responds to Sam in the group. Fucking hate this guy he growls. His mind has been made up, he’s given in to the desire. He wants what Sam has, he wants a legacy that his son will be proud of. 

8:20pm EST at last. Sam and Shawn both sit down on their respective couches. The Thursday night football theme playing through their homes. This is it. This is what we’ve all been waiting for. Sam gripping his favorite pillow, Shawn holding Christian as he sleeps. This night will decide everything, this night will put them on the path to glory or to shame. This night settles their feud, their clash of past and present. For this night their kickers face off  and it could change everything… 

Locked in for the next few hours, fates intertwined with every kick. Their ladies sense the tension in the air and kiss them goodnight, leaving them to their game. Knowing they won’t hear a word they say but still compelled to say something, anything to try and help. As if Ashley and Alyssa can feel there’s only one thing to yell back to them as they head off… 

Remember babe, “It’s just fantasy”",harrypottypots,https://www.reddit.com/r/LOADWeeklyArticles/comments/x92nyw/2022_week_1_preview_solden/,/r/LOADWeeklyArticles/comments/x92nyw/2022_week_1_preview_solden/,0,2022-09-08 14:58:07,2,,False,1.0,None,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789
AWagerADay,x92jbz,"September 8, 2022 Pick of the Day","***A Wager A Day - Daily Pick - September 8, 2022***

**Yesterday's Outcome: Won**

**Overall Record:** 26-20

**Buffalo Bills (-2.5) over LA Rams**

**Sport/League: NFL Football**

**Date:** 9/8/2022

**Time:** 8:20 p.m. EST

**Type:** Spread

**Duration:** Total Game

The Buffalo Bills are the media darlings of the offseason.  They are everyone’s Super Bowl pick and are the Super Bowl favorite according to Vegas.  Honestly, why wouldn’t they be?  They had a great year last year, a great offseason and all signs are pointing up for quarterback Josh Allen.  Tonight they open on the road against the Rams and are favored by (-2.5).  This is a fantastic bet!  It is a fantastic bet because I believe the hype surrounding the Bills and really think the Bills might just be a juggernaut this year!  Additionally, there are some rumblings from Rams camp that Matthew Stafford is dealing with some type of elbow issue, but is expected to start and play.  With that knowledge, he may struggle to keep up with the Bills high powered offense.  Additionally, Stafford may struggle against an extremely good defense, especially with an injury.  I am thankful that NFL football is officially back!  Let’s lock in the Bills to win and cover the spread tonight!",awageraday,https://www.reddit.com/r/AWagerADay/comments/x92jbz/september_8_2022_pick_of_the_day/,/r/AWagerADay/comments/x92jbz/september_8_2022_pick_of_the_day/,0,2022-09-08 14:52:44,1,,False,1.0,None,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

*if i was in a mlb team and knew this was going on i would be pissed beyond belief because it completely destroys the natural flow of the game, but i can feel for the umpires because they might get replaced by robots in two years and there is probably a lot of bad blood between them and the MLB but that still doesn't excuse any of this by a long shot.*

**+39.24** over 360 bets:

I think the proper way of abusing this is to either actually watch these matches live and look for weird behavior in the umpires or to find out where the most money is at in public bets and then taking the opposite side... with my way of doing it it looks like i can get something between a 40-50% chance of picking fixed matches but i think with the proper way it might be possible to get up to 70%

We were gifted with a high powered matchup to start the season and I personally can't wait. I've worked extremely hard over the summer developing a lineup optimizer, custom projections, prop tools, a salary comparison tool, a matchup tool, and much more.

# Captain Options

---

### Josh Allen (QB): $18,000 DraftKings, $17,500 FanDuel
Vegas has the over/under at an astounding 52 points. This game is going to be a shootout and one of the best options at captain is the commander of a top 5 passing offense. The Rams allowed the 21st most passing yards per game last year, and teams ran passing plays on the rams almost 62% of the time, which is the 28th highest in the league. We are going to want a QB-WR stack, and there's a solid chance Allen is the optimal captain. Allen scored 41+ DKFP in his two playoff games and is poised to continue at an elite level.

### Cooper Kupp (WR): $18,600 DraftKings, $16,000 FanDuel
I know, Kupp is expensive, but we know this game is going to be a shootout and this is a guy who averaged 28.3 DKFP per game last year. Kupp is matchup proof and will find a way to get his FPTS. Most will opt to save money and go with Josh Allen (rightfully so), but we can run with Kupp at captain alongside Stafford and bet on the Rams coming out on top in the passing department.

We are going to want a QB-WR stack, and there's a solid chance Allen is the optimal captain. Allen scored 41+ DKFP in his two playoff games and is poised to continue at an elite level.

### Cooper Kupp (WR): $18,600 DraftKings, $16,000 FanDuel
I know, Kupp is expensive, but we know this game is going to be a shootout and this is a guy who averaged 28.3 DKFP per game last year. Kupp is matchup proof and will find a way to get his FPTS. Most will opt to save money and go with Josh Allen (rightfully so), but we can run with Kupp at captain alongside Stafford and bet on the Rams coming out on top in the passing department.

sportsbook,x88b6o,Let's Talk About Teasers - NFL Week 1,"What's up everyone, if you are unfamiliar with this post or new to the subreddit, one of the things we love to take a look at each week here are the NFL betting lines that follow along with the betting strategies that Stanford Wong outlined for us regarding NFL Teasers. YES if you look below they don’t follow along exactly with how he set it out for us but I have done extensive research into the historical data and outlined the reasoning for how we do it here. 

If you are unfamiliar with Wong Teasers in general you can read the [week 1 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/) from u/blackjack_counter who has since deleted his Reddit. 

Or this [Wong Teaser Basics Article]( https://www.sportsgamblingpodcast.com/2022/08/01/degen-university-103-the-wong-teaser/
)I wrote over the summer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 6 Point Teasers

Our methodology for playing 6-point teasers is **similar** to Blackjack expert Stanford Wong's strategy:

- Tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, +2½, or +3

- Tease the favorite when the line is -7½, -8, -8½, or -9.

NOTE: The original Wong Criteria do not include +3 or -9 but this is how the post was done previously so we will continue to use them. Over the past 3 years it has only made a difference of about 1.5% to include those.


It is not recommended to tease game totals.


The reasoning behind this methodology is that games are frequently decided by a final margin of 3, 6, or 7. So we play teasers in such a manner that we gain these numbers in the teaser movement.


In the [week 1 post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/), u/blackjack_counter did a mathematical dive into whether we should be playing games at exactly +3, whether home teams are more reliable than road teams, and whether the total of the game matters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sweetheart Teasers

 10-point teasers are often called ""sweetheart"" teasers. Over the past three years, underdogs of +1½, +2, +2½ were 139-21 (86.88%).

After looking at a small sample size in 2017-2020, I've decided to track 10-point teasers according to the following methodology:

- For 10-point teasers, tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, or +2½;

- Take the favorite at -10 or -10.5

- Do not take sweetheart teasers at +3;

Reasoning: Over the past 3 years, favorites from -10 to -10.5 in a 10 point teaser have a record of 41-4 (91.1%) which is more than enough value to justify adding them to this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Week 1 Preview

**These are my opinions**

Overall, great season for Wong teasers in 2021, coming out at right about 90% hit rate for the full season on 6 point teasers. Looking forward to the 2022 season. Be sure to follow me here for each weekly update. Usually they will be on Wednesdays if there is a Thursday night game, or Fridays if there isn’t. 

Posting this a little early cause I am heading out of town but I will update this post on Sunday morning. Obviously, week 1 I probably have too many games that I will bet on. Taking a look at the lines that meet the Wong Teaser criteria right now, I will most likely be avoiding the Browns. Too much uncertainty surrounding the Panthers and the Browns as a whole. I really like the home dogs in the Cowboys and Vikings. The Vikings are a teaser dream for some reason and even more so now that Zimmer is out of there. I do like the Patriots as well if that line moves back to 3 by Sunday. I took a look and in the past 4 years the Patriots have never been a dog to the Dolphins and now we are getting 3 points? Yes I realize the Patriots won’t be super great this year but getting 9 points in a division game with Bill Belichik is a no brainer.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Week 1 Lines

For the purposes of tracking the results and staying consistent, I will continue to use Bovada's closing line. Please note that the results posted next week may differ from what is below due to line movement

This will show the total and the Record of that team as a 6pt teaser in the current situation this week. So if they’re an underdog, their record below will be their record as an underdog. The total is only on this chart so you can reference it. 

As of Wednesday morning, the unofficial list of Wong teasers this week are:

|**Wednesday Spread**|**Total**|**6pt Teaser Record since 2018**|**10pt**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Rams +2.5|52|7-3|9-1|
|Browns +1.5|41.5|7-3|7-2|
|Vikings +1.5|47|9-2|10-1|
|Cowboys +2.5|51|5-2|6-1|
|Jaguars +2.5|44|9-5|9-5|

# Historical Wong Teaser Records


*As of 09/13/21, the historical data has been standardized to the s3.sportsdatabase.com SDQL query for each teaser record. This yearly data report is run through that year’s regular season. This data excludes pushes. EX: Year 2018 data is collected from Week 1 to Week 17. 2021 season will be 18 weeks.


|**6 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--| :--|
|2018|+1½ thru +3|59-18|76.62%|
|2019|+1½ thru +3|52-18|74.29%|
|2020|+1½ thru +3|60-16|78.95%|
|2021|+1½ thru +3|67-17|79.76%|
|2018|-7½ thru -9|18-3|85.71%|
|2019|-7½ thru -9|13-4|76.47%|
|2020|-7½ thru -9|25-3|89.29%|
|2021|-7½ thru -9|24-5|82.76%|



|**10 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2018|+1½ thru +2½|35-3|92.1%|
|2019|+1½ thru +2½|35-5|87.5%|
|2020|+1½ thru +2½|34-6|85%|
|2021|+1½ thru +2½|36-3|92.3%|
|2018|-10 thru -10 ½|10-1|90.91%|
|2019|-10 thru -10 ½|10-3|76.92%|
|2020|-10 thru -10 ½|8-0|100%|
|2021|-10 thru -10 ½|13-0|100%|


Assuming a -120 payout for 2-team teasers, we must demonstrate better than 73.9% probability on each leg to show we have breakeven-or-better EV. **For a -130 payout on 3-team sweethearts, that threshold is 82.7%.** These are specifically for my book so yours may differ.

|**Teams**|**Odds**|**Implied Odds per Leg**|**Threshold**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2|-120|-282|73.8%|
|3|+150|-280|73.7%|
|4|+235|-283|73.9%|
|5|+350|-285|74%|
|6|+550|-273|73.2%|


Overall Weekly Records for 6pt teasers over the last 4 years (Week 18 is only 2021)

|**Week**|**Record**|**Win %**|
--|:--|:--|
|1|22-4|84.62%|
|2|17-3|85%|

|16|23-4|85.19%|
|17|9-7|56.25%|
|18|2-0|100%|

This shows that, historically, week 3 and 8 are the best weeks to bet these teasers for some reason.

# Original Criteria Results

3 years ago when this post started we have included +3 and -9 in the criteria. The Chart below is the results if you only played the original criteria outlined by Wong. Personally my guess as to what we will see here is the amount of games that meet the criteria will go down quite a bit and will result in a 1-2% win increase in the long run. But I could be completely wrong we will see!

|**Teaser**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|

# Regarding game totals < 49

The games with a total of 49 or less got brought up originally by u/blackjack_counter. In his week 1 post, he put:
>Do totals matter? Another word of advice that some Wong bettors give is to only play games with low totals. The idea certainly makes sense: points are harder to come by in a low-scoring game, so the 6-point tease is worth more. But what does the data say about this in the last three years?


From 2018-2021, here are the statistics including playoffs:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|234-65|78.26%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|177-50|77.97%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|36-13|73.47%|


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|76-15|83.52%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|60-11|84.5%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|12-1|92.3%|


If you wanted to look at only home favorites (Wong's original criteria is home favorites):


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|53-12|81.25%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|43-9|82.7%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|9-1|90%|


Although, u/blackjack_counter proved in his week 1 post that only betting home favorites for Wong teasers proved not to be necessarily a great bet.


Here is the results for 2022:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|0-0|0%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|0-0|0%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|0-0|0%|



|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|0-0|0%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|0-0|0%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|0-0|0%|

fantasyfootball,x87fm3,V1per's Week 1 Survivor/Eliminator Pick,"Okay everyone, you can stop messaging me about if I'm doing my survivor posts again this year because here it is.

In case you're new to these posts, I'm going to lead with the basic explanation, and have my picks at the bottom. For all weeks going forward, I'll have picks first, then the nerdy stuff.

&#x200B;

**What is this?**

Survivor/Eliminator is a type of fantasy football game where you pick a single team to win each week. Each team is only allowed to be picked once per season. Once a team you pick loses, you've been eliminated until next season. The game ends at the end of the regular season, or when there is only one person left.

My weekly posts dive into who you should pick each week based on a purely mathematical perspective.

&#x200B;

**Methodology**

I get team win percentages from 538 for every game in the entire season. I update probabilities for the current week based on Vegas betting lines to better take into account current team situations that 538's computer models can't account for.

With all of these values, I run something called the Hungarian Algorithm which solves the best possible choices to maximize the total win percentage values. This makes sure to use each team when it's optimal to do so.

The method used for this maximizes your chance of making it through the whole season undefeated. This is ideal if you are in a very large (70+ person) league. If however, you are in a small league that is unlikely to have everyone make it to the end and the last person standing is the winner, than the above picks will be less than ideal. If you're in one of these smaller leagues, download the file below, enter your league size and get the team list specifically for your league.

I make no personal evaluations of any teams or matchups. 538 has a very robust model and I trust the odds makers in Vegas and the people betting on those games to know more than I do. So if you're thinking, ""Do you really trust player X?"" or ""Are you really picking team Y on the road?"" The simple answer is that, other people with much more insight and knowledge than I could ever have have determined that Team A is that much better than Team B despite any special pleading from me or you. My picks are coming from a purely mathematical perspective using the odds that others have provided elsewhere. If you think a team isn't as good as their line suggests, then take it up with Vegas.

&#x200B;

**Download**

Every year I got a lot of ""well what if I have to pick multiple teams in week X?"" or ""What if my league, you have to pick only losers?"" or ""What about team A, B, or C this week?""

I tried to make the file as all encompassing as possible, so if your survivor league has some weird quark or wrinkle in it download the file and give it a shot. If the file still doesn't answer your question, let me know and I might add the feature in.

You can download the file [here from Mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/file/weaecfmprbe6hv4/NFL_Survivor.xlsm/file)

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer**

Yes I went undefeated two years ago. No, do not expect those results this season. 2020 had the highest percentage of people go undefeated in at least the last decade, so it was an easier year with fewer upsets. In 2019 I lost 3 games by week 12 and I believe I lost 3-4 games last year as well. This isn't a ""guaranteed to win"" system, just one that gives you the mathematically best chance of going undefeated.

The probability of going undefeated right now is 1.1%. This is typical to start the season, but really not great odds. Don't come harping at me if I pick a losing team.

With that out of the way, on to the picks.

**Week 1 Suggestions**

There are a lot of good options this week, but the San Francisco 49ers are my top pick.

&#x200B;

|Rank|Team|P(Win Week)|P(Win Out)|E(Wins)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|SF|74%|1.06%|14.00|
|2|DEN|73%|1.03%|13.97|
|3|BAL|74%|0.97%|13.94|
|4|IND|74%|0.94%|13.90|

We have 5 teams this week that are favored by either 6.5 or 7.0 points (the other being CIN). Going with any of these 5 teams will give you about an equal chance of making it through week 1, but SF doesn't currently have any usefulness rest of season so they are the team to go with.

&#x200B;

**Risky Pick**

The risky pick is the pick you should go with that will maximize your chances of going undefeated for the rest of the season at the expense of the current week. It's typically a team with a lower chance of winning in the current week but will have no usefulness rest of season so it will help you long term if you can pull off the win this week.

The risky pick this week is also the San Francisco 49ers. When this lines up with the suggested pick, it should be a no-brainer to just roll with it.

WSH (58%) & CAR (55%) are also small favorites this week with no usefulness ROS if you're feeling extra frisky.

&#x200B;

**Full Season Outlook**

The beauty of this model is that it looks at the entire season as a whole. Assuming you pick the 49ers this week, this is what the rest of the season's picks would look like based on what we know right now.

&#x200B;

|Week|Team|Opp|P(Win)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|SF|'@CHI|74%|
|2|LAR|ATL|83%|
|3|LAC|JAX|77%|
|4|PHI|JAX|75%|
|5|NE|DET|70%|
|6|GB|NYJ|83%|
|7|DEN|NYJ|76%|
|8|DAL|CHI|76%|
|9|CIN|CAR|75%|
|10|KC|JAX|82%|
|11|BAL|CAR|77%|
|12|MIA|HOU|79%|
|13|MIN|NYJ|76%|
|14|BUF|NYJ|84%|
|15|NO|ATL|76%|
|16|TEN|HOU|77%|
|17|TB|CAR|81%|
|18|IND|HOU|79%|

Looks like we have a few bad teams we are picking on this year. Plan is to pick against the Jets 4 times, and pick against JAX, HOU, & CAR 3 times.

&#x200B;

**Nerdy Math Stuff**

P(Win Out) = 1.06% -- This is pretty typical to start the year. We have about a 1 in 94 chance to go undefeated.

E(Wins) = 14.00 -- On average we should expect to lose about 4 games over the course of the season.",V1per41,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/x87fm3/v1pers_week_1_survivoreliminator_pick/,/r/fantasyfootball/comments/x87fm3/v1pers_week_1_survivoreliminator_pick/,101,2022-09-07 15:03:21,214,,False,0.97,None,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789
DynastyFF,x87cvm,Pickup Sam Howell now. Thank me later.,"Sam Howell will take over the Washington Commanders starting QB job eventually. Possibly at some point this year,  but if not then it’ll be going into next year. When he does take over he will be at minimum a top 18 fantasy QB and there’s a good chance he’s in the top 12. 

Why should you listen to me, a random Reddit stranger?  Not to brag but I’m 2 for 2 on my players that I’m most hyped about so far. I’ve been talking about George Pickens and Dameon Pierce since before the NFL draft. I absolutely loved them at their ADPs right after the NFL draft. I don’t post often but the majority of my Reddit posts were about them. I wagered on each of them to win OROY. Pickens at 40-1 back in April and Pierce at 22-1 in May. Obviously they haven’t proven anything in real games yet but they’ve gotten the most preseason buzz so far and both are among the favorites for OROY. 

Howell was my number 1 QB heading into the NFL draft. I’ll admit I soured on him a bit after he lasted until the 5th round. I would have liked to pick him in my rookie drafts but admittedly he wasn’t a priority target of mine at the time. I got him in one league and missed out in a couple of others. The  one league I drafted him in was a 14 team SF where I also took Pickett in the first. Since then I’ve traded for him in 2 of my leagues and picked him up off waivers in another. The only other league I’m in I’ve had a trade offer out for him for the last 3 days. Hopefully my potential trading partner doesn’t see this post. 


Howell’s preseason performance and training camp reports have gotten me hyped for Howell. 
Why am I so hyped on Howell ?

“The kids’ a baller”
“He has a very bright future in the NFL”
“He has moxie “
“Sam Howell is a winner”
“He’s going to be a problem in this league”

Those aren’t my quotes. They’re quotes from teammates and coaches during preseason camp. 

Sam Howell has had a very good camp. He’s looked really good in preseason games, not only throwing the ball but rushing for 2 TDs in one game and 90ish yards in another. I truly believe that once he gets the starting job he can be a Kamani (sp) Code QB which we all know is what we’re looking for in a fantasy QB. Why hasn’t Howell gotten any preseason hype?  Well he was a 5th round pick who’s not competing for the starting job going into the season. Wentz is the starter although I believe he’s on a short leash. Wentz is the guy who’s worn out his welcome on 2 teams in the past 2 years. Wentz was traded to Washington for a conditional 3rd that becomes a 2nd if he plays at least 70% of the offensive snaps this year. If the Commanders have a bad start this year not only will they want to see what they have in their rookie QB but they’ll want to sit Wentz so as not to have to give up what could be a very high second round pick. Betting on Howell means that you’re betting against Wentz which I’m fine with. 

What do I like about Howell?
First of all he’s still very young. Just turning 22 this month. He’s built like a RB. 6’1’ and 220 lbs. Tough kid. Runs the ball like a RB at times. Defenders bounce off him. Pretty sure he was one of the leaders in NCAA Yards After Contact stat for the 2021 season but I can’t find those numbers. After a prolific HS career went to NC and started as a true freshman, 18 years old at the time. Dominated from the start. Threw for 38 TDs. Won ACC Rookie Of The Year. Helped turn around a program that had won 5 games in the previous 2 years. His sophomore year was more of the same. Prolific passer. At this time last year, heading into his junior year, he was considered by many to be the top QB prospect and a possible 1st round pick. Went into his final season at UNC after seeing his top 2 WRs and top 2 RBs leave for the NFL.  I believe he also lost some of his offensive linemen. Howell’s passing numbers fell drastically without his best weapons. What’d Howell do?  He put the team on his back and rushed for almost a thousand yards. But his NFL stock fell because of his dismal passing numbers. Did Howell’s talent regress?  Did he get injured?  No. His numbers fell because of a severe lack of talent and experience on offense. Howell did the best he could with the talent around him. 

It’s widely acknowledged that Howell has the arm strength required for an NFL QB. At the Senior Bowl there was a throwing competition to see who threw the fastest ball in terms of MPH. Howell placed first. I believe Malik Willis, who is known for his arm strength placed second. You can tell there’s a lot of zip on his passes. Howell also throws a beautiful deep ball. 

At the moment you can still get Howell for cheap. I traded a 2023 3rd for him in one league and a 2023 3rd and a 4th for him in another. He may be on waivers in leagues with short benches which happened in one of mine. He’s going off at 70-1 for OROY on betting sites. I threw $50 on him. 

Is Howell a sure thing?  Of course not but at his price I think he’s a must have. I’m willing to take that risk both in dynasty and at the sports book.

u_These_Refrigerator83,x845pc,What You Should Know About Live Dealers,"Gambling goes a long way in sports. It can add adventure, magic, and fun to a game. For some people it can be a way to make money, and for others, it's just a hobby that they enjoy. There are different forms of gambling, and one of them is definitely live gambling.

Live Dealers for Live Sports Betting

There are different companies out there that offer live Dealers for live sports betting. You might hear about scalping (buying multiple tickets with a different ticket [pgslot](https://foxz168x.com/pgslot/) number each time), but you might also hear about people working for a stand-alone gambling/betting house, or an offshore sportsbook. Depending on which company you talk to, you might hear about bonuses or payouts that are unique to them, or might be different from one company to the next.

You can find out about any of these companies by just typing ""gamble"" or ""sports"" or ""betting"" on your favorite search engine. There are hundreds of opportunities for people to work and earn a livelihood from the internet. The potential for live gambling adds excitement to a game and represents something bigger than the Super Bowl or the Final Four. Live Dealers for live sports betting are ready to take your bets and help you make the correct picks.

The Field

There are a lot of things going on during the Football season. NFL teams are practicing and preparing for the next season. Players are honing their skills. Coaches are trying to figure out what their players' strengths are and weaknesses are, so they can have the best show of the season.

All of these things take place during the football season, but the one thing you really must know if you want the Football season to last longer is that you can bet an underdog. With the right tools and knowledge, you can bet an underdog for a lot of money.

The other thing about a successful football bettor is that he is patient. They don't bet on every game they can. If they see a long-time loser, like a last-place team, they won't bet on them. They will wait for a better situation, like a team that is on a hot streak.

Don't limit yourself to betting on your favorite team if you want a long-term success with Football betting. Find out what is going on with the other teams. Also, don't limit yourself to betting on only the games that you can watch on TV. Find out about the other games, too.

Chris Moneymaker learned that it is possible to beat the bookies at their own game. In 2003, after eleven years of betting, Moneymaker outdrew the casinos on the Heads-Up Poker Championship.

The magic is in the long-term moneymaking. It is possible to win big money during a football season, but you have to be persistent.

The next time you place a bet or two, please don't forget how lucky you are.Moneymaker bluffed the casinos by telling them that one of his opponents was actually a cheater and had stolen his winning ticket.Moneymaker won more than once using the same technique.

BackyardBaseball,x7xob7,BFFL Week 1 Projections,"Season 6 is about to begin! It's time to roll out the weekly projections post again. I like to classify these as ""half-truths"". I look at the stats, and I blend it in with what someone would predict or expect without any hints.

For this week only, the ""last week"" column is actually that player's average fantasy points per game from the preview season I played through. 

You may have to zoom out your browser in order to see it correctly.

#Quarterbacks

Pos|Player|Team|Opponent|Last Week|Projection|Comments.................................................................
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
QB|Jay Green|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|25.07|**35**|Jay Green OWNS the Melonheads. In two games against them, he's scored 53 and 51 points. Can he make it a triple 50? That would be awfully impressive. Just know that he's in a good position to start your fantasy season off with a W.
QB|Jimmy Rockfish|Fishes|@ Ponies|28.93|**33**|Jimmy Rockfish is back for more after finishing last season with the most fantasy points. Week 1 against a very weak team should show everybody why Jimmy was taken near the top of the draft.
QB|Thor Thwackhammer|Titans|vs. Browns|21.36|**30**|Thor put up two of his four 30+ point games last season against the Browns. Guess who he gets to play Week 1! I'm thinking Thor will hammer out another big game against these Browns.
QB|Sugar Stone|Browns|@ Titans|27.50|**29**|Sugar Stone should be started every single week, no matter who she's up against. Even though she only scored 4 last time she played the Titans. It won't happen again! I hope.
QB|Judy Abwunza|Packers|@ Vikings|21.71|**29**|Judy scored 30+ in each of her two games against the Vikings defense last season, so perhaps she's a candidate to go off once again. The Vikings defense allows the most yards in the league, which bodes well for Judy who can get it done on the ground and through the air.
QB|Brett Favre|Vikings|vs. Packers|25.86|**27**|Brett Favre is always a steady source of yardage on the ground and through the air. That's enough to make him a top tier QB in this fantasy format. The Packers and Vikings both have awful defenses so this could turn into a good old fashioned shootout. 
QB|Phyllis Granger|Orcas|@ Frogs|22.50|**25**|Phyllis had a 40-pointer against the Frogs last year and showed her strengths all season long as the Orcas capture the division crown. Phyllis should have another solid game here.
QB|Billy Jean Blackwood|Giants|vs. Cowboys|21.07|**24**|We'll see if BJB's rushing prowess continues this season, but she did perform well against the Cowboys in their two prior meetings, scoring 21 and 32. I think she'll put up some nice numbers this week.
QB|Allie Roberts|Wombats|@ Armadillos|19.71|**21**|Allie had one good game and one not so good game against the Armadillos last season. However, some of her best games were near the start of the season, including a 29-pointer against the Armadillos. Let's see what happens this time around. 
QB|Ryan Neapolitan|49ers|@ Saints|20.71|**20**|Ryan is back with a Cereal Bowl championship under his belt. He won't be the highest scoring fantasy QB you've ever seen, but two of his best games last season came against the Saints, so this could be a good week for him.
QB|Needle Haystack|Pigskins|@ Colts|17.14|**20**|Needle will never have a huge game, but he's got a good chance for a solid game here. The Colts are one of the worst teams in the league and Needle should take advantage. 
QB|Cornbread Eaton|Melonheads|@ Monsters|21.64|**19**|Despite the Melonheads' shortcomings against the division rival Monsters, Cornbread put up two solid games against them, scoring 24 and 22. But to reach those numbers again, he'll have to be efficient on the ground.
QB|Tony Delvecchio|Jets|@ Stars|16.29|**18**|Tony is a low end FLEX QB, as he rarely scores above 20 points, but he also rarely goes below 10. If you can afford a QB in the teens, Tony is your guy. Even against a tough Stars defense, he should get enough rushing yards to be worth it.
QB|Cade McNown|Rockets|@ Hornets|22.21|**18**|Cade faced the Hornets twice last season and put up some modest numbers, 19 and 15. The Hornets have a swarming defense, no pun intended, and could pressure Cade into some interceptions. 
QB|Drew Bledsoe|Cowboys|@ Giants|17.93|**17**|Against the Giants previously, Drew has scored 9 and 25. Which Drew are we going to see this week? Let's predict him around his season average with the disclaimer that there's a lot of variance here.
QB|Sally Dobbs|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|17.00|**16**|Sally finished the season strong with 29 points against the Wombats in the season finale. But in their other game, she scored a -2! Yikes. It would be awful if Sally went negative again, but she's a competent QB and can figure out what needs to get done.
QB|Shirley Sorenson|Broncos|@ Seahawks|14.71|**15**|The Broncos face the Seahawks in the BFFL and the NFL this week, and the Broncos are favored in both cases. However, unlike the NFL version, these Broncos do not have a new all-star QB. They have Shirley, who will put up serviceable numbers at best.
QB|No Name 3 174|Frogs|vs. Orcas|15.79|**15**|No Name is a low end QB most weeks, including this one against a tough defense. She has an uphill battle this week. I'd only consider her for the FLEX if you have no other QB to fill the slot.
QB|Matt Monday|Stars|vs. Jets|15.07|**15**|Despite being the QB of the conference champion Stars, Matt isn't otherworldly when it comes to fantasy football. He basically just gives it to Pablo, which is beneficial if it's a pass, but worthless if it's a handoff.
QB|Flora Wilkenson|Hornets|vs. Rockets|16.29|**14**|Flora is not usually a likely target for a huge 30+ point game, but if you're concerned about consistency in your 2nd QB spot, than Flora might be the girl for you. She's a reliable source of about 15 or so points.
QB|Mikey Thomas|Saints|vs. 49ers|13.57|**14**|Mikey is not one of the most promising QBs out there from a fantasy standpoint. His lack of a running game hurts his potential. Against the 49ers here, Mikey will have to throw it deep if he wants to rack up the points.
QB|Georgette Washington|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|14.57|**14**|The Seahawks might be better off if they switched the positions of Georgette and Ben, but this is what they're working with. Georgette is probably not a great candidate for even a FLEX spot this week.
QB|Johnny Omar|Colts|vs. Pigskins|14.07|**13**|Johnny Omar is a BBL legend, but we've never seen him as a featured player in the BFFL. After the preview season, I think I know why. Anyway, he'll be a nice source of nostalgia for at least one person in this league, but maybe not the best QB candidate out there.
QB|Lori Temple|Ponies|vs. Fishes|13.50|**12**|Lori was the worst fantasy QB last season, and if she wants to turn that around, she'll have to prove herself. A big test comes right off the bat against the division-winning Fishes. This could be a tough one.

#Tight Ends and Running Backs (TERBs)

Pos|Player|Team|Opponent|Last Week|Projection|Comments..................................................
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
RB|Victor Jones|Saints|vs. 49ers|4.71|**13**|The most intriguing fantasy player this week is Victor Jones. Last time he faced the 49ers, he went off for 42 fantasy points! But it should also be mentioned that the first time he faced them, he only scored 6. This lottery ticket could pay off big time for you if the Saints give Victor a power-up or two.
RB|Henrietta Fender|49ers|@ Saints|9.86|**10**|Henrietta was the top TERB off the draft board this season and should be back for some big numbers. Well, relative to other TERBs, that is.
TE|Kimmy Eckman|49ers|@ Saints|9.36|**9**|Kimmy knows her role in this 49ers offense and will get her touches. As her fantasy coach, you're hoping she gets that ball in the red zone.
RB|Mickey O'Connor|49ers|@ Saints|6.79|**8**|Mickey doesn't have the big game appeal of the two 49ers TERBs ahead of him on the depth chart, but he holds his own and is a reliable receiver. He's a decent starting TERB option in this format.
TE|Stinky Steiner|Fishes|@ Ponies|4.50|**8**|Stinky could see the ball thrown his way as the Ponies defense doesn't do a great job of stopping anybody. Stinky caught a touchdown in one of his two games against the Ponies last season.
TE|Kiesha Phillips|Pigskins|@ Colts|6.57|**8**|Kiesha is one of the few tight ends that I trust week in and week out. If the Pigskins get out to an early lead, they'll make sure that all mouths are fed.
RB|Ricky Williams|Pigskins|@ Colts|5.64|**7**|Ricky is a rarity; he's an AI running back that actually gets used. He should be a pretty good play in the TERB slot this week.
TE|Julio Henderson|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|3.00|**7**|Two of Julio's only good games in the previous year came against the Melonheads, with 7 and 15 points. If you're desperate for a TERB this week, Julio is worth a look.
TE|David Wilco|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|6.79|**7**|Perhaps the most appealing TERB who wasn't a 49er, David will have a lot of eyes on him this season. He may disappoint you at time, but he's a key piece in this Seahawks offense.
RB|Steve McNair|Rockets|@ Hornets|2.71|**6**|Steve wasn't allowed to show off all his talents last season, but we know what he's capable of. The question is if he will be allowed to touch the ball or not.
RB|Bridget Oofar|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|2.93|**6**|The Seahawks don't have many rushing attempts of which to speak, so maybe Bridget could carve out a bigger role for herself.
TE|Joshua Mariott|Broncos|@ Seahawks|5.14|**6**|Joshua was a highly ranked TERB in the draft this season, mostly due to the ineptitude of other TERBs around the league. Let's use the first few weeks to gauge just how well he's going to do. 
TE|Lulu Legosi|Packers|@ Vikings|4.79|**6**|Lulu is not the worst TERB you could have out there, but you should know that she didn't score a point against the Vikings in either game last season. Let's hope she can buck that trend.
RB|Ken Ivanov|49ers|@ Saints|3.86|**5**|Ken might carve out a role for himself this season and end up on the TERB radar, but for now, he's still the 4th string TERB on this Niners squad.
RB|Cullen Sullivan|Jets|@ Stars|3.21|**5**|Cullen almost sees more action than the Jets' starting tight end. I wouldn't start him quite yet.
RB|Tinky Tootsmore|Fishes|@ Ponies|4.57|**4**|Tinky's best hope for fantasy points is finding the end zone, but the hard part is convincing Jimmy to give up the football.
RB|Sophie Hubley|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|3.64|**4**|Sophie is an inconsistent rusher, but the Monsters dominated the Melonheads twice before. This may be her opportunity for garbage time action.
RB|Cisco Kidd|Packers|@ Vikings|4.50|**4**|Cisco gets a few yards on the ground here and there, but Judy and Olivia do most of the heavy lifting.
TE|June O'Shea|Browns|@ Titans|5.64|**4**|June is just on the outskirts of being a top tier TERB. The Browns just have too many weapons and it's hard to use them all.
TE|Andy Gibbons|Colts|vs. Pigskins|4.14|**4**|Andy is usually the QB I rag on in the predictions for getting sacked all the time. Let's switch it up by ridiculing him for being a below-average TERB.
TE|Petunia Young|Hornets|vs. Rockets|4.43|**4**|Petunia is rather hit-or-miss in her role on the Hornets offense. If only her brother Horace would stop hogging the ball!
TE|Dmitri Petrovich|Wombats|@ Armadillos|3.00|**4**|Dmitri has some flare ups every now and then but isn't the most consistent TERB out there.
RB|Daisy Dewchester|Hornets|vs. Rockets|2.71|**3**|
RB|Karla Karloff|Ponies|vs. Fishes|4.21|**3**|Karla and Pinky may get their token 3 points in this game, but I don't expect much more in a tough matchup
RB|Pinky Purton|Ponies|vs. Fishes|3.29|**3**|Karla and Pinky may get their token 3 points in this game, but I don't expect much more in a tough matchup
RB|Becky Arthur|Stars|vs. Jets|1.64|**3**|The Stars kinda give all their TERBs a shot here and there, but trying to predict which one will have the best game out of the bunch is almost a useless exercise.
RB|Chester Drawers|Stars|vs. Jets|2.64|**3**|The Stars kinda give all their TERBs a shot here and there, but trying to predict which one will have the best game out of the bunch is almost a useless exercise.
RB|Chico Pappas|Stars|vs. Jets|2.00|**3**|The Stars kinda give all their TERBs a shot here and there, but trying to predict which one will have the best game out of the bunch is almost a useless exercise.
TE|Betty Houston|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|3.36|**3**|Betty is on the low end of the eligible tight ends, but she may surprise us every now and then. Although not this week.
TE|Dan Doorknob|Jets|@ Stars|3.64|**3**|Dan has never been an earth-shattering tight end, so he probably still shouldn't be on your radar yet.
TE|Frankie McDoogle|Rockets|@ Hornets|2.93|**3**|Frankie definitely thrives more as a receiver, but check on this situation to see if the Rockets ever include him in their offensive strategy.
TE|Mike Schwartz|Stars|vs. Jets|2.71|**3**|The Stars kinda give all their TERBs a shot here and there, but trying to predict which one will have the best game out of the bunch is almost a useless exercise.
TE|Marky Dubois|Titans|vs. Browns|1.93|**3**|Marky has been a great tight end in season's past, but he doesn't appear to fit in the Titans' scheme. Stay tuned, though.
RB|Ashley Webber|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|2.21|**2**|
RB|Audrey Campbell|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|1.29|**2**|
RB|Jorge Garcia|Broncos|@ Seahawks|1.00|**2**|Jorge's bank account may look nice, but his fantasy resume doesn't. 
RB|Cory Barker|Browns|@ Titans|2.21|**2**|
RB|Ed Pollard|Colts|vs. Pigskins|3.36|**2**|
RB|Carlos Ocampo|Giants|vs. Cowboys|3.50|**2**|

RB|Sidney Webber|Titans|vs. Browns|2.79|**2**|
RB|Allison Pacino|Wombats|@ Armadillos|2.86|**2**|
TE|Zena Fromme|Cowboys|@ Giants|1.36|**2**|Zena didn't do much in the Cowboys offense last season and doesn't appear to have a big role.
TE|Junior Seau|Giants|vs. Cowboys|2.57|**2**|Junior is used more for his blocking than his receiving and rushing skills for the Giants.
TE|Pickles Peterson|Melonheads|@ Monsters|3.43|**2**|Pickles has been a star in the past, but that was at WR. He's still finding his footing as  TERB.
TE|Lisa Crocket|Orcas|@ Frogs|3.93|**2**|Lisa isn't having the greatest time as the Orcas tight end. Maybe she's upset that she's the Mad Dog but Mad-Dog Morrotto is her teammate.
TE|Leah Wayne|Ponies|vs. Fishes|1.93|**2**|Leah doesn't see much offense here and mostly is a blocker. You could find a better TERB somewhere else.
TE|Jocinda Smith|Vikings|vs. Packers|3.07|**2**|The Vikings offense mostly runs through Favre and the Deb's, so Jocinda is used more as a blocker, despite her all-around ability.
RB|Lindsey O'Rearden|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|2.14|**1**|
RB|Ramona Bennett|Cowboys|@ Giants|2.14|**1**|

RB|Tammi Waters|Wombats|@ Armadillos|1.50|**1**|
TE|Crazy-Legs Calonzo|Frogs|vs. Orcas|0.79|**1**|Crazy-Legs is the lowest ranked pure tight end, having scored just 11 points last season. 9 of those came in one game. Don't be crazy.

#Wide Receivers

Pos|Player|Team|Opponent|Last Week|Projection|Comments..................................................
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
WR|Hans R. Dirtywashum|Giants|vs. Cowboys|26.36|**30**|Hans was among the upper echelon of wide receivers during fantasy drafts this season, and for good reason. He's tall, fast, and excessively better than any other Giants receiver. He's in for a big game against his division rivals.
WR|Winky Wojohowitz|Browns|@ Titans|20.29|**29**|Winky had a monster game against the Titans last season, with 51 points! He definitely likes this matchup. I would start him with confidence.
WR|Tina Herrara|Broncos|@ Seahawks|21.21|**28**|Tina is the most valuable Bronco to have, and she also put up two masterful statlines against the Seahawks in the preview season. She should be your top WR for sure this week.
WR|Yasmin Kristov|Titans|vs. Browns|19.21|**27**|Yasmin has the Browns' number. Last season she dropped 47 and 35 in two separate outings against them. She's primed for a big game to start your season off.
WR|Cynthia Miller|Orcas|@ Frogs|28.07|**26**|Cynthia was a bona fide first round fantasy draft pick, and for good reason. She should start her season off with a bang against this subpar Frogs defense.
WR|Horace Young|Hornets|vs. Rockets|20.71|**25**|Horace is the heart and soul of this Hornets offense, and he often delivers. He finished last season with a 46 point performance against this Rockets defense. I doubt he will duplicate that, but we know what he's capable of.
WR|Pablo Sanchez|Stars|vs. Jets|20.93|**23**|Pablo did put up a 0 against the Jets last season, but I'm not worried. The Stars offense runs through him, and he'll get his fair share. The Jets better watch out.
WR|Ernie Steele|Colts|vs. Pigskins|18.43|**22**|In two games against the Pigskins last season, Ernie scored 29 and 32 points. You'd love to have that this week, but it's no gimme. However, the Colts get the ball to Ernie in any way they can, including on the ground.
WR|Stephanie Morgan|Fishes|@ Ponies|21.21|**22**|Stephanie was solid last season and has the upper edge against this Ponies defense. Stephanie had one good game and one bad game against the Ponies last season, but hopefully the adrenaline rush of Opening Day gets her going.
WR|Knuckles McGhee|Rockets|@ Hornets|20.93|**22**|In his two games against the Hornets last season, Knuckles scored 43 and 2. Talk about highs and lows! For this matchup, let's predict him right in the middle, which is pretty close to his season average.
WR|Debra Hannigan|Vikings|vs. Packers|18.36|**22**|Debra has the upper hand amongst the Debs in this Vikings receiving corps. The fact that she's also involved in the running game gives her a little boost to her score each week. She's a good start here against a poor defense.
WR|Vicki Kawaguchi|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|15.43|**21**|Vicki is the one shining light on this Seahawks team and should be in your fantasy lineup more often than not. Here against the Broncos, the 'Hawks could take advantage of a defense that rarely records interceptions.
WR|Maria Luna|Ponies|vs. Fishes|15.43|**20**|Maria will be the one saving grace as the Ponies start their season against the defending division champs. If the Ponies want to get anything going, they'll have to throw it to her early and often.
WR|Mr. Clanky|49ers|@ Saints|18.50|**19**|While his QB Ryan had some great games against the Saints, Mr. Clanky had some of his worst games against the Saints. That's because the Niners don't throw it to Clanky when they're winning, and they jumped out to a lead in both games. Here's to hoping the Saints keep it close!
WR|Ricky Johnson|Broncos|@ Seahawks|12.64|**18**|Two of Ricky's four 20+ point games came against the Seahawks, so Ricky has a slight chance of putting up some nice numbers. But don't be disappointed if he doesn't live up to it, as his average is around 13.
WR|Olivia Harris|Packers|@ Vikings|16.21|**18**|Olivia was one of the hottest wide receivers out of the gates at the beginning of last season, but she cooled off considerably towards the end. Let's see if she can recapture that early season magic facing this Viking team that allows a ton of yards to opponents.
WR|Travis Diamond|Pigskins|@ Colts|15.36|**18**|Travis has the most footballs on his player card than any generic or backyard kid, but he's never really been a top option in the BFFL. He's always just kinda there. He'll score 18 points this week and nobody will even notice. 
WR|Amir Khan|Cowboys|@ Giants|15.79|**17**|Amir enjoyed a solid season and is ready to be a steady contributor. He's at least a FLEX, maybe even a 2nd WR, against most defenses, including the Giants defense here.
WR|Liz Levin|49ers|@ Saints|12.14|**16**|Liz is a solid second receiver in this offense that passes for the most yards per game by far. The fact that she led the league in receptions last year is already a reason to consider her for your FLEX spot. 
WR|Nutzy Nussbaum|Frogs|vs. Orcas|12.29|**16**|If the Frogs want to pull a big upset, they'll have to get Nutzy involved. They're at their best when they get the ball in his hands. But No Name has to not get sacked for that to occur.
WR|Kenny Kawaguchi|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|14.21|**16**|Kenny's best game last season was a 52-point bludgeoning of the Melonheads last season (that accounted for a quarter of his total points!). But Star went off in the other game. Who will have the big game this time? It remains to be seen. 
WR|Star Moonbeam|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|12.86|**16**|Star's best game last season was a 49-point bludgeoning of the Melonheads last season (that accounted for more than a quarter of her total points!). But Kenny went off in the other game. Who will have the big game this time? It remains to be seen. 
WR|Pete Wheeler|Jets|@ Stars|15.57|**15**|Pete has the height advantage over the short Stars, but he may not have the speed advantage. Still, Tony could chuck up long bombs to him all day if he wanted to.
WR|Dante Robinson|Melonheads|@ Monsters|14.29|**15**|Dante has scored 43 and 0 against the Monsters in two games. Well the Melonheads definitely won't if Dante never touches the ball, so they'll probably find a way to get it in his hands again.
WR|Reese Worthington|Packers|@ Vikings|12.86|**15**|Reese ended his season by dropping 26 fantasy points against the Vikings, the most he scored in any game. Was that a sign of things to come, or just him leaving it all out on the line in the season finale?
WR|Nestor Carpenter|Saints|vs. 49ers|9.93|**15**|Nestor is the Saints' fast receiver, but he's technically the \#2 receiver on the depth chart, which means most of the plays are designed for George Coleman. But the big play potential is better for Nestor, and he also outscored George both times the Saints faced the 49ers last season. Nestor could be a surprise this week.
WR|Wendy Harmon|Wombats|@ Armadillos|16.21|**15**|Wendy scored just 5 points each time she played the Armadillos before, but I know she's capable of more than that. And the Wombats will sure need some participation from her if they want to win.
WR|Tiffany Bosworth|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|11.00|**14**|Tiffany's fantasy points come in spurts, like they did last season with 28 against the Wombats in Week 14. Let's hope for another outburst like that, but if you have other options, they might be more worthwhile.
WR|Donovan McNabb|Rockets|@ Hornets|11.64|**14**|Donovan is a nice complement to Knuckles, knowing his role. He could very well siphon a touchdown off of Knuckles for his own stats if the Hornets focus on the other McReceiver.
WR|Tracy Ulrich|Wombats|@ Armadillos|8.79|**14**|Tracy's only 20+ point game of the season was a 31 point outburst against the Armadillos in Week 2. She may be able to recapture some of that magic again, especially if the defense fixates on Wendy Harmon.
WR|Chucky Flinder|Colts|vs. Pigskins|13.57|**11**|Chucky is a decent second WR for the Colts, but Ernie does get the majority of the targets. Still, 13 points per game from the \#2 receiver is nothing to scoff at.
WR|Marcie Mallow|Melonheads|@ Monsters|12.21|**11**|Marcie has her moments, but the Monsters have posed a tough challenge for everybody on this team. Marcie is a desperation FLEX play, for this week anyway.
WR|Debby Nagasawa|Vikings|vs. Packers|10.93|**11**|Debby seems to be held back in this offense a little bit. Maybe she just misses being a QB. Whatever the reason, she seems to be a low-end FLEX receiver at this point.
WR|Fred Benson|Frogs|vs. Orcas|11.57|**10**|If you're a gambling man, Fred could be a prospect. He's a boom-or-bust, touchdown-dependent receiver. He could get a long touchdown worth double digit points, or he could get nothing.
WR|Annie Frazier|Hornets|vs. Rockets|8.71|**10**|Annie is one of those touchdown-dependent receivers. If she finds the end zone, she'll have a good game. But if she doesn't, you run the risk of her putting up a 0.
WR|George Coleman|Saints|vs. 49ers|10.14|**10**|Two of George's worst games came against the 49ers last season, but the good news is that he has a higher chance for receptions in a game against the user. Racking up the receptions will be his most likely way to reach double digits this week.
WR|Luanne Lui|Browns|@ Titans|12.57|**9**|Luanne started and ended her season with goose eggs . I'm hoping this season starts off with a crooked number, but it's hard to tell with her. 
WR|Greg Bonnell|Cowboys|@ Giants|11.43|**9**|Greg is a curious case who will rely on touchdowns to get any significant fantasy points. This Giants defense poses a formidable matchup, as Greg doesn't have the height advantage here.
WR|Whitney Singh|Ponies|vs. Fishes|9.86|**9**|Whitney was heating up towards the end of last season until she scored 0 against the Fishes. In this rematch, she'll look to bounce back, but it could be a tough task for her. 
WR|Rich Gannon|Titans|vs. Browns|13.71|**9**|Rich's season came to a crashing end, scoring just 6 points over his final four games. He'll look to rebound as a new season approaches, but don't expect too much from him.
WR|Stuart Sullivan|Jets|@ Stars|6.07|**8**|Stuart will need to see the ball in the red zone, because the Stars defense is too fast for him to break free on a long bomb. But the Jets tend to run the ball around that area.
WR|Mad-Dog Morrotto|Orcas|@ Frogs|10.71|**8**|Mad-Dog concedes most of the receiving on this team to superstar Cynthia Miller, but he'll have his moments every now and then. But if you start him, you're basically betting on a touchdown from him.
WR|Clarice Reid|Fishes|@ Ponies|9.00|**7**|Clarice doesn't see the light of day with Stephanie Morgan being the clear top receiver for the Fishes. However, there is a slight chance of her breaking free for a long TD with that speed of hers.
WR|Mikey Tice|Giants|vs. Cowboys|6.29|**7**|Mikey has the double whammy of being painfully slow and having an incredible WR playing next to him. However, like I often say, if the defense decides to double-team Hans or something, Mikey could find himself open in the end zone.
WR|Barnaby Miller|Stars|vs. Jets|10.36|**7**|Barnaby is a BFFL newbie but might not get picked up by a team any time soon. He surely won't this week, when he's facing the Jets against whom he scored a total of 4 points against in two meetings last season.
WR|Amy Bostwick|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|5.07|**6**|Amy, like Ben None, is a former QB who probably wishes she was back at QB. She'll have to make it work as a receiver.
WR|Ben None|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|7.07|**6**|Ben is not his usual dominating self playing WR instead of QB. He'll probably remain on the waiver wire for most of the season.
WR|Bill Larsen|Pigskins|@ Colts|4.86|**5**|Bill gets less action than TWO TERBs on his team. That usually happens when you're on my team, not the AI! Anyway, Bill will probably be a free agent all season long.

#Defenses


Pos|Player|Team|Opponent|Last Week|Projection|Comments.............................................
--|--|--|--|--|--|--
DEF|Orcas Defense|Orcas|@ Frogs|16.04|**18.5**|The Orcas defense should feast on the Frogs, who finished their season at just 4-10. I don't think orcas and frogs ever meet in the wild, but if they did, the result would be the same result you'll see here.
DEF|Fishes Defense|Fishes|@ Ponies|14.25|**18**|The Fishes' stifling defense is a good matchup against the Ponies. In their two previous meetings, the Fishes put up 22 and 17 fantasy points. They're a great option here.
DEF|Jets Defense|Jets|@ Stars|13.29|**16.5**|The Jets defense was right around the middle of the fantasy rankings, but their two best games came against the Stars. Take that as you will, but I smell a trend.
DEF|Stars Defense|Stars|vs. Jets|18.43|**16**|The Stars defense was tops in the fantasy rankings, with some going out of their way to draft them first. If your plan is to start them every single game and not worry about them, that's not a bad plan. 
DEF|Armadillos Defense|Armadillos|vs. Wombats|14.71|**14.5**|In their previous two meetings, the Wombats dominated one game, and the Armadillos dominated the other. What's gonna happen in the rubber match? The Armadillos defense is slightly better on paper, but both are pretty good options.
DEF|Broncos Defense|Broncos|@ Seahawks|13.71|**14.5**|The Broncos defense is about as average as you can get, but I like their chances against the Seahawks this week. They will pick up where they left off, scoring 15 points against the Seahawks in last season's finale.
DEF|Pigskins Defense|Pigskins|@ Colts|14.18|**14.5**|The Colts took like half the season to get their first win, mostly because teams like the Pigskins kept kicking them down. This matchup is in the Piggies' favor.
DEF|Saints Defense|Saints|vs. 49ers|12.54|**14**|As there always will be when facing the 49ers, there's a chance for the Saints defense to rack up a bunch of turnovers. But the tradeoff is that the Niners also rack up a bunch of yards. But the Saints defense could be a savvy play this week.
DEF|Wombats Defense|Wombats|@ Armadillos|14.11|**14**|In their previous two meetings, the Wombats dominated one game, and the Armadillos dominated the other. What's gonna happen in the rubber match? The Armadillos defense is slightly better on paper, but both are pretty good options.
DEF|Monsters Defense|Monsters|vs. Melonheads|12.36|**13.5**|The Monsters have dominated the Melonheads in two straight games, although it was mostly from an offensive standpoint. Still, the Monsters have the upper hand in this matchup. 
DEF|Rockets Defense|Rockets|@ Hornets|12.39|**13**|The Rockets have a middle-of-the-pack defense, but the Hornets have a slow QB in Flora Wilkenson. This may result in more sacks than normal for the Rockets, but likely not enough to push them into starting candidacy.
DEF|Giants Defense|Giants|vs. Cowboys|14.50|**12.5**|The Giants defense was awfully consistent last season, so I see no reason not to trust them here. Their across-the-board height works wonders.
DEF|Hornets Defense|Hornets|vs. Rockets|15.11|**12.5**|The Hornets got off to a slow start last season, feasting on weaker opponents as the year went on. Unfortunately, there are some great offenses in their division. We'll see how they start this season off, but it might not be their best effort.
DEF|Titans Defense|Titans|vs. Browns|12.32|**12.5**|The Titans' best *and* worst games this past season on defense came against the Browns. So your guess is as good as mine for which way this will go. Let's predict them around their average.
DEF|49ers Defense|49ers|@ Saints|12.86|**12**|The 49ers defense is a decent option here against a low level Saints squad. They could get to Mikey Thomas a few times in the backfield, but all it takes is a long power up play to cut into their yardage allowed.
DEF|Browns Defense|Browns|@ Titans|14.00|**10.5**|The Browns defense didn't put up good numbers against the Titans either game, despite clearly being the better team. If you have other options, they might be worth a look. 
DEF|Frogs Defense|Frogs|vs. Orcas|11.71|**10**|The Frogs are near the bottom of the fantasy defense rankings, and they have two of the most potent offenses in their division, the Orcas and Browns. Could be a rough few weeks for these guys.
DEF|Cowboys Defense|Cowboys|@ Giants|10.64|**9.5**|The Cowboys have a low-end defense, and the Giants have a competent offense. This looks to be a bad combination for fantasy purposes.
DEF|Ponies Defense|Ponies|vs. Fishes|10.64|**9**|The Ponies might have their hands full trying to stop \#1 draft pick Jimmy Rockfish. In their last two games against the Fishes, the Ponies Defense scored a combined 16.5 points. Better options exist for sure.
DEF|Seahawks Defense|Seahawks|vs. Broncos|13.89|**8.5**|The Seahawks faced the Broncos twice last season and didn't fare very well in either matchup. The Seahawks don't mesh well with the Broncos' pass attack. 
DEF|Packers Defense|Packers|@ Vikings|9.50|**8**|The Packers allowed the second most yards to opposing offenses last season. Luckily the only team ahead of them is their opponent this week. Still, this game could turn into a shootout and I recommend neither defense.
DEF|Vikings Defense|Vikings|vs. Packers|11.89|**8**|The Vikings defense was unable to stop the Packers very well in either of their two previous meetings, so I wouldn't advise starting them this game either.
DEF|Colts Defense|Colts|vs. Pigskins|10.00|**7.5**|The Colts have one of the worst defenses in the league, and the Pigskins have like 5 different players that can beat you. Good luck trying to stop them all!
DEF|Melonheads Defense|Melonheads|@ Monsters|11.82|**6.5**|The Melonheads' two worst defensive games last season came at the hands of the Monsters. The Monsters seem to have their number. I would stay away from this matchup.

I think the proper way of abusing this is to either actually watch these matches live and look for weird behavior in the umpires or to find out where the most money is at in public bets and then taking the opposite side... with my way of doing it it looks like i can get something between a 40-50% chance of picking fixed matches but i think with the proper way it might be possible to get up to 70%

sportsbetting,x7sjcw,Which sportsbook has the best new customer promos this year?,"So last football season was the first football season that sports betting was legal in AZ. So the promos for AZ customers on sportsbooks like fanduel and draftkingz were insane. If i remember correctly I deposited like $50 and got like $200 in free bets. They were $25 free bets and I got 8 of them. Hit on a good amount of them and turned that to $480 in a week. Then lost it all over the course of the whole NFL season as I obviously was destined to do.

So which sportsbook is offering the best promos this year??",DonnyLongCallz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbetting/comments/x7sjcw/which_sportsbook_has_the_best_new_customer_promos/,/r/sportsbetting/comments/x7sjcw/which_sportsbook_has_the_best_new_customer_promos/,1,2022-09-07 01:59:56,2,,False,1.0,Discussion,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789
dfsports,x7ptm7,Analysis: Expected Value and Pick Hit Rate on Underdog and Thrive,"Feels good to be back! I've worked extremely hard over the summer developing a lineup optimizer, custom projections, prop tools, improving the website, and much more. I plan to post an article/video for each NFL slate this season.  


I wanted to start the year by analyzing the pick rate you need to profit on Underdog and Thrive Fantasy. Underdog Fantasy recently added an ""Insurance"" feature that prompted me to look into this.  


I have prop tools for Underdog Fantasy and Thrive Fantasy on my website that primarily look at the odds on a sportsbook like DraftKings and compare it to the selections on Thrive. For example, if one of our options is Josh Allen 0.5 INTS and his line is -160, this is a high-value selection.  
**Thrive Fantasy** [(prop tool link)](https://www.easydfs.com/premium/thrive/)

|Number of Picks|Multiplier|Pick Odds to Break Even|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3.6x|52.7%|
|3|6.2x|54.43%|
|4|11x|54.91%|
|5|20.5x|54.66%|

As we can see, 2 player prop cards are the way to go. Assuming each of our picks has over a 52.7% chance of hitting, we have a positive expected value. Keep in mind that 54+ % props pop up all day, and I've had massive success betting 2 pick cards with high-value props only. The multiplier does not scale up enough as you add players to warrant the extra risk in needing to hit 3+ props instead of just two.  


**Underdog Fantasy** [(prop tool link)](https://www.easydfs.com/premium/underdog/)

|Number of Picks|Multiplier|Insurance Multiplier|Pick Odds to Break Even|Insurance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|3x|\-|57.74%|No|
|3|6x|\-|55.03%|No|
|4|10x|\-|56.23%|No|
|5|20x|\-|54.93% |No|
|3|3x|1x|57.74% |Yes|
|4|6x|1.5x|55.03% |Yes|
|5|10x|2.5x|54.75% |Yes|

For those unaware, Underdog recently added a new feature called insurance. With insurance, you can miss one prop and still cash out at the cost of worse multipliers. If you miss one prop your multiplier drops to the ""Insurance Multiplier"" listed. For example, if you do a 3-pick card with insurance and hit all 3, you get a 3x return. If you get 2 of the 3 correct, you get a 1x return.   
If you are looking strictly at value,  a 5 Pick card with insurance is best. However, I'd rather bet on the 4 picks with insurance or 3 picks instead. Very similar odds and a higher hit rate.   


Thrive Fantasy is the clear winner... right? On a small scale, yes. Underdog typically has a much larger selection of props and has more soft/high-value picks. I'd rather bet a 3 card of 60+% picks on Underdog than a 2 card of 54% picks on Thrive.  


Okay, we now have a good idea of how many players to put in our cards, but how do we know if our picks have over a 54% chance to hit? This is where the prop tool comes in. It frequently updates with new lines and compares them to another sportsbook's odds to find discrepancies and favorable picks. Below are snapshots of the top picks for each platform.  


&#x200B;

[Underdog Prop Tool Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/5gnmb32hsbm91.jpg?width=985&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e249e15d00d798c1818679ba984571c2c7cdffe)

[Thrive Prop Tool Snapshot](https://preview.redd.it/kvl2ztglsbm91.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2a484cf372059ffe8c5df40511853c66aaa70c5)

As we can see, the prop tool found several props on both platforms that would give us a positive expected value. It is clear that Underdog has more high-value picks, but Thrive has plenty of combinations we can bet on as well that is expected to lead us to profit.  


Of course, you don't need specific percentages on your props to utilize the information given. I hope this helps you guys when deciding to make one 4-player card or two 2-player cards on Thrive or determine if insurance is worth it on Underdog.

SportsBettingandDFS,x7p0jg,NFL Future Bets to make prior to Week 1 from CheatSheetPros!,"[https://www.cheatsheetpros.com/post/nfl-future-bets-for-2022-from-cheatsheetpros](https://www.cheatsheetpros.com/post/nfl-future-bets-for-2022-from-cheatsheetpros)

**NFL Future bets to make prior to Week 1!**

**QUICK NEWS & NOTES:**

**Wanted to share some of my favorite NFL Season Props!**  

📷

**BALTIMORE RAVENS OVER 9.5 WINS**

Looking at the **NEW 2022 NFL CheatSheet** we can flip through the schedule and projected lines for different teams prior to Week 1.  I marked off the ""W's"" in what I think should be a **""WIN""** and then the checkmarks to the right are the coin flip games that could likely go either way.  Baltimore has a tough early schedule facing NE on the road and Buffalo and Cincy at home.  In their first 8 weeks I have them beating only the Jets and Giants and then the Miami, New England, Cleveland and Tampa Bay games are coin flips for me for honestly I think they could win all of those games.  If they start off splitting those and going 4-4 in the first 8 then I think this bet is **LOCKED UP**!  In the second half they have **Carolina, Jacksonville, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Pittsburgh** again which should be 5 wins even if you have them losing to the Saints.  This puts us at **9 wins** and we only **need one more** between: u/Saints**, vs. Denver,** u/Cleveland**,** u/Cincinnati or their Week 18 game.  I think they have 7 easy wins locked up and then they only need to win 3 of the other 11 games which shouldn't be too difficult.  

**TEAM PREVIEW:**

Lamar Jackson is a stud, J.K. Dobbins is getting healthy, Gus Edwards will be back, Mark Andrews emerged last year as an elite TE-1 and even the rookie Isaiah Likely looks great.  In the pre-season Isaiah Likely had a 100% catch rate (12/12) with 7 forced missed tackles and had a 94.1 PFF grade. PFF ranked Baltimore as the top secondary in the league with Marlon Humphrey, Marcus Peters and adding Kyle Fuller.  They lost Marcus Peters last year to a torn ACL in training came but now should reap the benefits of an elite secondary and strong running game.  

📷

**PHILLY OVER 9.5 WINS**

Looking at the schedule above I marked off 9 games they should ""Win"" so taking over 9.5 isn't a reach for me.  I think the Arizona, Dallas, Green Bay, Tennessee and New Orleans are coin flips and the Eagles would only need to go 1-4 to hit this OVER.  Another way to approach this is they have 5 games against pre-ranked bottom 7 teams in the NFL (NYGx2, CHI, HOU and JAX) so can you find 5 other games they can win?  I think Detroit will be sneaky this year so if they lost Week 1 to DET, lost Week 2 to the Vikings they could still come back and win the W3/W4 games and start 2-2.  The next 2 games they play ARI and DAL so let's say this split 1-1 in those coin flips that gives us 3-3 after 6 games.  They should beat PIT, HOU and WAS and jump to 6-3.  Likely they will lose to IND on the road and then they play 2 home games vs. Packers and Titans and while I think they can win both let's say they split 1-1 again putting us a 7-5.  Now for the last 5 games with a modest projection they get NYG twice and Chicago which should give them 3 more wins to hit 10.  The 15th and 16th game vs. DAL and Saints they could go 0-2 in those and still be at 10 wins.  **I think it's very likely they are sitting at 12 wins at the end of the year.**  

The **positives for their schedule** is they can get off to a quick start and get ahead of Detroit in Week 1 before they put everything together.  They get MIN @ HOME so they don't have to travel which is a benefit for Philly and then WASH/JAX they could likely start 4-0 if things go right.  If that happens we still get NYG twice, HOU and CHI for what should be 4 wins to put us at an EASY 8.  They can split the WASH games and DAL games (DAL struggles on the road) and hit the 10.  I think it's also benefician they get Packers @ HOME and Titans @ HOME.  

**TEAM PREVIEW:**

PFF ranked the Eagles secondary as 13th to start the year with James Bradberry and Darius Slay on the outside and the defensive line ranks 9th.  On the offensive side they added A.J Brown and Smith will have another year under his belt.  Really like the Eagles this year!

📷

**CHICAGO BEARS UNDER 6.5 WINS**

I wasn't on the BEARS under this year because I figured it was 5.5 or 6.0 but it was 6.5 when I checked my book this am.  Let's look at a quick breakdown: PFF ranks the **BEARS secondary as 31st** in the NFL with their highest rated defensive back sitting with a horrible 56.9 grade and it was less than that the prior year.  The **BEARS defensive line ranks 31st** in the NFL which means bad news for the young QB.  

Chicago / Houston / Atlanta pre-rank the 2022 season in the bottom 3.  I think HOUSTON and the Dameon Pierce hype but that is for another day.  Bears play HOU / NYG / ATL / NYJ and theose are their most likely wins but I think it's more of a coin flip game, giving the bears any LOCK to win anything is obserd right now.  I think Houston can run all over them so that will be a tough out, NYG aren't supposed to be good but put Saquon Barkley up against that DEF and he could go bonkers.  You can't expect the Bears to go on the road to the Patriots as Bellichek is also a tough out even if his team isn't the best.  They have virtually no shot to beat **San Fran, Packers, Vikings, Cowboys, Eagles and Bills**.  That makes up 8 of the 17 games so in the other 9 games can they go 7-2?  HECK NO!  Best case scenario I think they win 5-6 games but can't see 7.  If they split against Detroit going 1-1 and then beat HOU, NYG, WAS, ATL & NYJ that is only 6 wins and that is if everything falls correctly and they win several of those games that they will be dogs in.  

📷

**TITANS UNDER 9.5 WINS**

Indy is set up to take this division and Titans are going to take a step back this year.  I think losing A.J. Brown is going to hurt.  If we give TEN the ""gimmie wins"" against the bottom ranked teams that puts them at 6 wins.  The games I don't think they can win are against Buffalo / Indy / KC / Denver and Chargers giving them 6 losses.  So in the other 5 games  they need to be at 4-1 to get the over.  Those games are:

**vs. Las Vegas -** Raiders won't be an easy out - coin flip for me but lean to Raiders.

**@ Green Bay Packers** \- Aaron Rodgers at home always a tough out, Titans project to be around a 5 point dog.

**vs. Cincinnati -** Bengals made a great run last year and this should be a coin flip game.

**@ Philly -** Love the Eagles this year and game projects to be ""pick'em"".

**vs. Dallas** \- Cowboys are an unknown this year but struggle on the road.  

I don't think they can go 4-1 in the above games so I'm putting this on an UNDER 9.5 play.  Even if they win 3 of them that gives them only 9 wins on the season.  

📷

**DIVISION WINNER PARLAY!**

Even though I have been sports betting for over 25 years with offshore sportsbooks and local bookies my state just legalized sports betting giving me access to a huge amount of promotions, new sportsbooks and better odds!  DraftKings and BetMGM were the first two that I dove into thanks to the $200 in free bets/plays, etc.  They just rolled this out on 9/1/2022 so it was less than 1 week ago!  One of the things I did was start looking at ""Same Game Parlays"" and ""Division Winner Parlays"".

**TEAMS I LOVE TO LOCK UP THE DIVISION:**

**BUFFALO BILLS (-225)** 

Bills are LOADED this year and will make a strong run for the Superbowl.  Von Miller is biggest add to that defensive line and don't forget about Tre'Davious White (who will miss Week 1). NYJ (28th) won't have a shot so we can write them off.  New England (17th) is middle of the road this year. Miami (16th) is the unknown with all the new toys. Looking at the schedule below Buffalo could lose Week 1 and still manage 12 wins and that's giving them some coin flip losses to teams like BAL, KC, MIN and CIN.  Miami could put up around 8-9 wins but I think they will struggle against BAL / BUF / CIN / MIN / SF / LAC & Packers.  Schedule is much tougher for Miami.

📷📷  


**INDIANAPOLIS COLTS (-140)**

The AFC South comes down to 2 teams the Colts or the Titans.  I think we can write of Jacksonville (29th) and Houston (31st) from competing for a division title.  Titans (14th) start the season with high hopes but losing A.J. Brown is going to hurt.  They will go into the season with Robert Woods, Westbrook-Ikhine and rookie Treylon Burks.  Derrick Henry will be a huge help to keep them in games and keep the clock moving.  The COLTS (10th) also have a stud RB in Jonathan Taylor who averaged 5.5 yards per carry last season and rushed for 1,811 yards and 18 touchdowns.  He was #1 in rushing attempts, yardage and touchdowns.  Colts & Titans both have solid defensive units and stud running backs trying to carry them to a division title.  

**BALTIMORE RAVENS (+145)**

Cleveland (21st) and Pittsburgh (22nd) don't have high expectations this year but the Ravens (7th) and Bengals (12th) should compete for the division.  We discussed above in the win total for the Ravens how they could hit 10 and push 12 wins this season and while Cincy has a cake schedule they should be around 8-10 wins coming in 2nd in the division.  

**THE PARLAYS I'M LOOKING AT:**

**BUFFALO / INDIANAPOLIS / BALTIMORE - PAYS +500**

**TAKE THE TOP 3 + VIKINGS (+250) - PAYS +2000**

**TAKE THE TOP 3 + CHARGERS (+250) - PAYS +2000**

**TAKE THE TOP 3 + EAGLES (+150) - PAYS +1400** 

📷

**OTHER FUTURE BETS THAT ARE JUICY!**

📷

**SEAHAWKS UNDER 2 DIVISION WINS**

Seattle plays in the NFC West so they will play the SuperBowl Championship Rams twice and should be a double digit dog in both games, San Francisco 49'ers twice and projected to be a 6 and 3.5 point dog and the Arizona Cardinals and they are projected to be a 4 and 7 point dog.  Heck if they got lucky and won 2 of those games that is a PUSH but I don't think there is ANYWAY they are winning 3!  They won't beat the Rams so it comes down to the 4 games between Arizona and San Francisco and I think they would be lucky to win 2 of those!  

📷

**BILLS OVER 4.5 DIVISIONAL WINS +135**

At this price we only need to win this bet 43% of the time.  Bills have 6 divisional games and this is giving us plus money for a 5-1 run.  NYJ should be two wins and then New England should be two wins and they can split with Miami and go 5-1.  If you think Buffalo can thump New England twice then love this over at +135!

📷

**EAGLES OVER 3.5 DIVISIONAL WINS +110**

Eagles should be able to knock off the Giants twice and Washington twice giving them 4 wins and then they will likely split with Dallas 1-1.  I think they are good enough to win all 6 games but even if they split with Dallas, split with Washington and beat Giants twice that's a win!

**RUSHING TITLE FOR 2022!**

📷

Jonathan Taylor is the favorite at +450 but those are low odds for the RB that has only done it one time.  I'll take my chances and move down the board.  I like **Derrick Henry at +650** and **CMC at +3000**.  Henry rushed for 1,540 yards in 2019 putting up 5.1 yards per carry and then in 2020 he got even better and rushed for 2,027 yards and 5.4 yards per carry.  Before he was injuried in 2021 he had 8 games and already rushed for 937 yards putting him on pace for around 1,800 yards.  I also like the **Touchdown PROP over Taylor for +650** if you don't trust his yardage.  Who else are the Titans going to in the red zone?  Henry put up 16 TDs in 2019 and 17 TDs in 2020 and then in 2020 he already had 10 in only 8 games putting him on pace for 20!  Indy has stated all summer they are going to scale back the carries for Taylor and they over used him last year.  Henry is in the final years of his contract and got a $2 million dollar raise this year with 2023 being his final year.  CMC is just my dart, he rushed for 1,387 in 2019 and then has been hurt each of the last two years and stated he finally feels 100%.  

**Thoughts on other backs:** Cook always misses a few games each year due to injury and they work in Alexander Mattison limiting his upside.  Nick Chubb could get some big run while they are waiting on Watson.  Najee Harris has a horrible offensive line and the ability to catch 70 balls takes away from his ""rushing"" yardage.  Joe Mixon is the same with all the receiving yards.  Love JaVonte Williams but Melvin Gordon will still take 35-40% of the snaps.

BettingPicks,x7oj63,BUF-LAR Under 52.5,"

Let's take a trip back nearly 7 years to revisit a personal triumph (even though I only won $5) because I am using the same type of analysis for the BUF-LAR game.  Oddly enough, both game feature(d) Matthew Stafford.

 

Way back on 2015-10-18 CHI was at DET.  Per the Sports Database the closing lines were DET -3.5/45.  Jay Cutler (JC) was widely regarded as a lousy QB.  Matthew Stafford (MS) had neither won a Super Bowl nor established his current reputation as ""Mr. Clutch,"" leading the NFL in 4Q comebacks.  Outside of regional fans and fanatics, few fantasy football bettors would have chosen either player with early picks.  CHI was off 3 straight Unders, and DET had scored 17 or less in four straight.

It looked like an Under, but both teams had weak pass DEFs.  I did bet Over and, unlike most times when I don't, I did post my opinion.  Disrespected JC and MS combined for a whopping 758 passing yards.  The final score was CHI 34-DET 37; it went way Over.

BUF and LAR feature many hotshot OFF players than many fantasy football players probably grabbed with early picks, including Josh Allen (the MVP favorite), MS, Kupp and Diggs.  Like the CHI-DET game, the perceptions of the QBs and OFFs overly influence the bettors, and the linesmakers know this.  This provides a nice high total to shoot at.  In 2021 BUF had the #1- and LAR had the #4-rated passing DEF efficiencies.  I took Under 53.5 for 1.5 units; Heritage Sports had a surprisingly high total when I placed my wager on 2022-08-31.  I still like Under at 52.5

FYI:  Tyler Fulghum of Daily Wager expects this game to ""fly over,"" and he is certainly a sharper sports bettor than I am.  Good luck everybody.",4Three2day,https://www.reddit.com/r/BettingPicks/comments/x7oj63/buflar_under_525/,/r/BettingPicks/comments/x7oj63/buflar_under_525/,4,2022-09-06 22:58:01,1,,False,1.0,NFL,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

BettingPicks,x7o3ya,Rookie &amp; Retiree Week 1,"

Week 1 and yes, Post 1.

I’ve been betting on the NFL since the days of Montana and Marino and was lucky enough to be at a game where those greats played against each other (and learned a valuable lesson). Back then, sports gambling was exclusive to the local Goodfella, and if you didn’t pay up after a loss you got a visit from a fella who was not so good, like Joey the juice-squeezer, an ex-con who was very funny. He was also very big, very ugly, and carried a hand grenade instead of a handgun. Yep, Joey was a good reason to abide by the gambling rule of only betting what you can afford to lose, or you may lose what you cannot afford. It’s a different world now, with everything legal, online, analyzed and fantasized, and that has brought a lot of new blood to the game, like my young rookie friend, who has asked me for advice with office picks. Ok, if a young rookie is open to listening to an old retiree who bets with his gut then hey, let’s help the rook beat the office book.  

I will recommend only two teams a week (and a double combining them).  

Week 1

Week 1 is the start of a new season where every team is undefeated and looking forward to success, but, for gambling purposes, I like to look back to last season. And what I look for are good teams that had a bad beginning and a bad ending, the kind of bad that needs to be rectified before focusing on this season. Three teams stand out to me this year; one is the Packers, who are on the road against an underrated Vikings, so we will avoid them. Another is the Indianapolis Colts, who lost their first two games at home and then missed the playoffs by losing their last game to the worst team in the league. They are on the road in Week 1, playing against the Texans, who had a great opening-day win at home last year, but that win was against a team full of rookies and problems. The Colts are not that team. With their nasty offensive line, rushing-title winner, and a solid veteran now at QB, the Colts are not missing the playoffs this year.

The other team is the Tennessee Titans, who earned the number 1 seed in the AFC, which got them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. And how did they use that big advantage? They blew it, and lost their opening playoff game. All that hard work in the regular season, wasted. They also got crushed in the first game of the season, their home opener, because of multiple mistakes by the offense and defense. Both those bad home losses, at the beginning and end, will be remembered by players and fans and especially by their tough head coach (who also bears responsibility for them not being prepared to play their first game last season), and I am expecting those bad memories to instill a winning attitude in this Titans team for this game. Other reasons: All the questions about how the loss of AJ Brown will affect this team – do you think that will motivate the offense? All the questions about how the loss of Landry will affect the team – do you think that will motivate the defense? And all the buzz about how Saquon Barkley is ready to run people over this season – do you think that will motivate Derrick Henry? 

Week 1 Survivor Pool pick: Colts to win vs. Texans.

Week 1 Spread pick: Titans (-5.5) over the Giants.

Week 1 Money Line Double: Colts & Titans.

Ok, my rookie friend, I will see you back here in Week 2.

Note: This Sunday we Remember the true Titans. It is the anniversary of 9/11 and the events of that day started a global war on terror that still goes on. So for everyone who has been involved, by will or by chance, from 9/11 to now, I will offer a prayer at church and a toast before kickoff:

Hello All, Good to be back and hope everyone had a great summer. The 2021/22 NFL season was profitable but as noted above I did not do well in the playoffs. This year I plan to improve my season winning percentage and without question get better in the post season. All my bets are are Bet365. I made some early plays last week after preseason and may post more before the weekend. Also, I have jumped on some early week #2 lines from Bet365, which is dangerous to wager but I could not resists. Anyways, here is what I have played to date:

 

Week #1 - Locked in @ Bet365

 

Balt (-6) - This opened at (-5.5) but I could only get it at (-6) and now has risen to (-7). I would not be surprised to see this go even higher by game time. Not much to say here other than the Jets have a long way to go and the Ravens are ready to rock. I hope Lamar does not sign a contract before the season so he will play with a major chip on his shoulder. Let's see how it plays out.

Tenn (-6) - I got this line @ (-6) and it has gone down further to (-5.5). I was worried it was going to go up; it appears I am not forecasting the money properly in this one. This game is simple for me, the Titans crapped the bed in the playoffs but still bring back a solid team. More importantly, I have no confidence in the Giants at this time.

Minn (+1.5) - I'm drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. Minny appears to be poised to take a run at the division and GB looks ripe for the picking. It's never a good idea to go against Aaron Rodgers but I think his team is going to take a step back this year. We will see.

Den (-5) - This line opened at (-4.5), I got it at (-5) and it's now at (-6.5). I think this will move over the magic number 7 by game time. Several story lines here but I think (hope) Russ is not who we saw finish last year in Seattle. Typically I would worry about going into Seattle on a Monday but I think Denver is a complete team and can overcome the 12th man. Also, the Seattle's team isn't going to put up many points on anyone this this year but I think their defense will surprise some people (very young and fast).

 

Week #2 Picks - Locked in @ Bet365

 

S.F. (-9) - Could not resist this line. It will easily go over (-10) by game time. I am laying of Trey Week #1 to ensure he gets his feet wet and the schedule is not kink to Seattle going into S.F. after Monday night.

Dal (-2.5) - I think the Bengals are going to also take a step back this year. I luv Burrows but think the line is right for the Cowboys to cover at home. I also think the public money will move this line over 3.

 

That's all for now.....Happy Punting! GL2A",RJay15,https://www.reddit.com/r/BettingPicks/comments/x7ny90/rsu_sports_nfl_wk1_ytd_000/,/r/BettingPicks/comments/x7ny90/rsu_sports_nfl_wk1_ytd_000/,3,2022-09-06 22:32:27,1,,False,1.0,NFL,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

[WEEK ONE NFL BETS](http://blueribbonbets.com/2022/09/06/nfl-week-one-bets/)

Picks and Excerpts from the blog 👇 

Bills ML (-130)
Uncertainty with the health of the Rams backfield. Uncertainty of the status of Stafford’s elbow. Rams won the super bowl and are about to have a ring ceremony in what is genuinely one of the least caring fan bases in the NFL. 

Ravens -6.5 (-120)
Ravens are the most forgotten team from 2021. They were absolutely amazing early in the season, while overcoming an unreal amount of injuries. 8-3 through week 12 before injuries to Lamar and other became too much to overcome. They know they’re disrespected and are gonna come out firing. Harbaugh is a good coach and that is something I look for the most in week 1 as adjustments are more prevalent than ever throughout the season. 

Bears +7 (-115) & Under 41.5 (-115)
I think this game is the biggest unknown. We have honestly no real idea how the 49ers offense is going to run. We know how the Bears offense wants look, but I don’t know if they are able to achieve what they want, at least to begin the season.

Saints -5.5 (-110)
Tbh I just think the Falcons are gonna be total ass this year, especially starting off. I hate taking road favorites week 1 and I don’t really have a lot of thoughts other than that I simply think the Saints are 6 points better than Atlanta. Hopefully a decent crowd from NOLA also travels in for the game. 

Lions +4 (-110)
Goff is 4-0 ATS in week one his last four seasons. Lions fans are READY for a good season and they’re gonna be fired up. I like the Eagles to win their division this year, but I think this is a hungry lions team that can keep it close. I would say Eagles most likely win by 3 or less. 

Panthers -2.5 (-110)
Baker is ready to roll against his old team that simply disrespected THE FUCK out of him. And I guarantee you, his team has his back. I bet the Browns think they’re amped up to face Baker, but it’s going to be nothing in relation to the level the Panthers are ready to go at. 

Cardinals +6 (-110)
One of the Hardest schedules in the league, and the first 3 games are no joke. Kingsbury is dying to get out there and show his team is genuinely in the upper echelon, Cardinals always start off fast, and this next one might sound outlandish but… (continued on blog)

Giants +5.5 (-110)
I love the prospect of Daboll as Head Coach with a quarterback like Daniel Jones and a running back like Saquon. He could greatly improve Jones in every conceivable aspect and finally has a capable running back to give him a run game he could never establish in Buffalo.

Vikings ML (+100)
Viking are my sleeper team of the year. This offense is criminally underrated. People act like they don’t have a QB that can sling it, possibly the best WR in the league in Jefferson, a touchdown monster in Theilen, and a top 10 running back in the league. 

Cowboys ML (+120)
Tyron Smith going down admittedly worried me a lot. But right now, I don’t care. Cowboys will come out hyped for this, and the Bucs don’t truly care if they start the season a little slow.

sportsbetting,x7hrou,NFL Futures and Write-ups,"** 1. Courtland Sutton (950) and Jerry Jeudy (915) over their receiving yard props. **

a. The Broncos are getting a gigantic upgrade in QB’s with Wilson instead of Bridgewater for the current year. I also think the coaching upgrade specifically on the offensive side of the ball will be great for Sutton and Jeudy.
b. Although Courtland Sutton did play every game last year and didn’t hit this mark, I think that was mainly due to coaching, qb play, and injuries. Sutton tore his ACL in 2020, advanced stats tell us that players generally need 2 years to fully recover and resume production to before the injury (reminder that Sutton had 1,100 yards in 2019 with Flacco)
c. In 2020 Metcalf and Lockett both had over 1k yards, and in 2021 they both had over 950 yards, proving that Wilson can provide for both receivers
d. For the Broncos season they are expected to go against the 5th easiest pass defenses.


**2. Seahawks under 2 Divisional wins (-115 on DK)**

a. Might be my favorite bet here. Not sure if there is any Drew Lock believers out there
anymore but I don’t think it’s ever a good situation if you’re competing for a starting qb job with Geno Smith. For this bet to lose, Drew Lock or Geno Smith has to go 3-3 or better against the Rams, 49ers, and Cardinals. No fucking way. Not to mention their defense was 31st against the pass last year according to PFF. The chances of this pushing are somewhat big but seeming how my money wont be doing anything else besides sitting in the bank I might as well try investing for the nfl season. One thing that could play a factor is the seahawks play the rams in the last game of the year and the rams may potentially be resting their starters. Still, that’s only one game and a big maybe at that. Currently the Seattle win total is at 5.5.........I just don’t see how they get wins, and if they were to win games I don’t see it possible in this division.


 ** 3. Lions over 6.5 wins **

a. Yes I’ve been drinking all of the fucking kool-aid for the lions this year. They have the 5th easiest schedule this year compared to having the 28th in last year
b. Last year when Campbell called plays and Jared Goff was healthy the lions were 2-3
c. They have 8 games against the projected bottom 10 teams in the league
d. They have 0 weeks with less rest than the opponent
e. 2nd least amount of travel miles for the year.
f. Noticeable games: Bears 2x, Giant, Seahawks, Jets, Commanders, jaguars


** 4. Allen Robinson over 875.5 yards **

a. Allen Robinson has had dog shit qbs for his entire career and this year he gets Stafford along with Sean McVay who can actually call plays compared to Nagy.
b. Before tearing his ACL Robert Woods was on pace for 1050 yards last year for the rams
c. 2018, 2019, 2020 were all years where the top 2 receivers in the rams offense passed this mark
d. I would hope defenses make some changes and cover Kupp just a tiny bit more. Which should open up opportunities for ARob.


** 5. Kirk Cousins over 4200 yards passing **

a. Vikings were bottom 14 in NFL pass rate last year (however the rams were only a few spots ahead which is where the coach O’Connell is from). Still I think Mike Zimmer was an extremely conservative coach and am looking forward to kirk slinging the rock more often.
b. O’Connell helped Stafford throw for almost 4900 yards last year
C. Kirk has gone over 4,000 yards in 6 of the past 7 season (Reminder that 6 of those seasons were with 16 games). Even with Zimmer at the helm he still threw for over 4200 yards in the past 2 years.


**6. Michael Pittman over 1025 yards**

a. From 2018-2020 Matt Ryan gave his top receiver an average of over 1400 yards a
season. In 2021 the Falcons top receiver in yards was rookie tight end Kyle Pitts with
1026 yards
b. Matt Ryan is better than Carson Wentz
c. In 2021 Pittman had 1080 yards, the next closest receiver had 380 which isn’t good, and with the colts drafting a WR in the 2nd round, Pittman’s volume could decrease. Although the colts ran the ball so much last year that I expect there to be more passing yards for the team as whole.
d. If one were to take stock in what coaches say during camp, Reich did say he wanted to pass more this year and take pressure off JT. We also Saw Pittman and Ryan tearing up the Lions in a joint practice


**7. Bills/Bucs division winners (+100)**

a. Yes this extremely chalky. I still think it’s great value though. The Bills are the biggest superbowl favorite and top to bottom have a great team. Same with the Bucs, I’m not going to bet against Brady.
b. While the Bucs team has offensive line injuries already, I still think they will be good. Brady is extremely good at getting the ball out early.
c. Jury is still out on the saints, I’m not very sure how they will be with Jameis back and no Sean Payton. However I still think it’s the Bucs division to lose and I don’t see Brady
unretiring to barely make the playoffs or not make them at all.


** 8. Brandin Cooks over 950 yards**

a. Cooks has gone over 1k yards in 6 of his 8 seasons as a pro
b. Cooks had a 27% target share last year which was 7th highest in the NFL
c. The Texans didn’t get any wide receiver help in the offseason (They did draft a WR but he has leukemia and is out indefinitely at the moment)
d. If you were to average out the 12 games Cooks and Mills played together in 2021, Cooks would be on pace 1100 yards for the season
e. The Texans will probably be playing from behind a lot so Cooks should have
opportunities at the end of the games to boost his stats.


**9. Rashad Bateman Over 825 yards**

a. 45% of the Ravens targets are up for grabs as the Ravens let a couple receivers go.
b. They did not draft anyone or bring in a free agent of significance
c. Bateman struggled last year in part due to an early injury. While having a full offseason and coming into this year healthy, he could be primed for a big breakout year.
d. Hollywood Brown had 1k yards last year and that was with Lamar only playing 12 games
e. Camp reporters have been saying Bateman has been “catching everything coming his way” and developing great chemistry with Lamar

Leans

**McLaurin over 975 yards**

Mclaurin has also had to put up with some extremely bad quarterback play throughout his career and Wentz will be the best he has had.
b. While I like McLaurin’s talent level, I am concerned now that Washington drafted a
WR pretty early, and now have a healthy receiver in Curtis Samuel who could take some targets away as well. However McLaurin has hit the over 2/3 seasons with the exception being his rookie year where he hit 920 yards.


**Ravens SB**

a. If I were to place a future on any team it would be the Ravens, I believe they have
the best value, as somehow there are 9 teams ahead of them odds-wise.
b.The Ravens were in the #1 seed spot after 12 weeks with Lamar at the helm, then he was injured...........
c. After the injury the ravens went 0-5
d. With a healthy Lamar Jackson the ravens can beat anyone 
e. Overall the Ravens had terrible injury luck last year as well.


**Derek Carr Over 4400**

a. 4 straight seasons with over 4k yards including last year where he threw for 4800 yards.
b. He hasn’t missed a game in 4 years
c. He just got Davante Adams
d. I’m unsure how the offense will change with Josh Mcdaniels being the coach here
and not confident enough to place any money on this. However, I do think Derek Carr is underrated and will need to be playing out of his mind to keep pace in the AFC West.


Notice how most of these props are on the over. While I know overs are more of a “sucker” bet, I genuinely believe they are easier to identify when doing season totals. For an under to hit I think injuries have to play a role in some part. And injury probabilities and stats are something I am not knowledgeable on and I feel as if it is more based off luck. Instead I try to focus on opportunities and new developments across the league that can factor into a player performing better than Vegas thinks he can.",peteypablo9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/x7hrou,/r/sportsbetting/comments/x7hrou/nfl_futures_and_writeups/,4,2022-09-06 18:21:25,11,,False,0.93,Discussion,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

[31/32 reporting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSGm8zqV9a2mHqNt5b_dj4REIQ2DpqH7hzQ7Dui3trjRBvUsgNFcyzi8j09urVo0L24ulqI_pjInG3I/pubhtml?gid=167658153&single=true)

1.	| [](/BUF) | Bills | 	11-6	|	The Buffalo Bills are the betting favorites to win the Super Bowl, and it is absolutely terrifying. On paper, this team is primed to do it all. Other than the continued absence of All-Pro Cornerback Tre'Davious White as he rehabs an ACL tear, and the varying degrees of question marks at running back, it's hard to point out too many holes on this Bills roster. Each year, teams surprise us in how they exceed or fall short of expectations. It's one thing to say the Bills are good enough, now they need to go out and get it done. With the Bills slated as the first game of the season against the defending champ Rams, the city of Buffalo and BillsMafia across the world hold their breath.
2.	| [](/LAR) | Rams | 	12-5	|	The list of noteworthy departures (Woods, Hekker, Von Miller, Whitworth, OBJ, KOC & more) certainly seems to outweigh the noteworthy additions (Robinson, Wagner) but the Rams made the most of their offseason and there’s no reason to think they can’t contend for a second straight Super Bowl. The core remains intact with McVay at the helm plus the NFCW has one less chef in the kitchen. Anything but another deep playoff run would be a disappointment.
3.	| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | 	13-4	|	With just 17 years away from being able to collect Social Security, the Masked Singer (?) returns for his 23rd and likely final NFL season. The Bucs enter the season with unexpected shifts to their core offense, hampered by surprise retirements (Ali Marpet, Gronk) and injuries in camp (Jensen), but might find a small boost from free agents Julio Jones and Russell Gage. To start the season, the Bucs will face a strong Dallas team with a feisty young defense, but a coach on the hot seat in Mike McCarthy. QB Dak Prescott has had close to an 80% completion rate on the Bucs in recent matchups. It should make for a thrilling shootout. 
4.	| [](/KC) | Chiefs | 	12-5	|	It is a year of transition for the Chiefs with Tyreek Hill being surprisingly shipped off to Miami over the offseason. The Chiefs went from the 23rd youngest team in the NFL in 2021 to being the 7th youngest team in the NFL heading into the 2022 season. The Chiefs are staring down a brutal schedule this year filled with tough divisional games along with many playoff teams from last year. Whether the Chiefs get through this tough looking schedule will depend on how they adjust to life without Tyreek Hill and how the team's nine rookies play. The Chiefs still have Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Andy Reid so the ceiling for the team is high - but now the question becomes what the next era of Chiefs football with Mahomes looks like in a rough AFC.
5.	| [](/CIN) | Bengals | 	10-7	|	The Bengals are coming off of their most successful season in over 30 years, but the majority of the football media have determined that last season's Super Bowl run was a fluke. The team again finds themselves labeled as underdogs. Will that disrespect motivate them enough to repeat as AFC champs? 
6.	| [](/GB) | Packers | 	13-4	|	After a disappointing Divisional round defeat, the Packers reloaded for another Super Bowl run with Aaron Rodgers at the helm, now on his 15th year as the Packers starting QB. The big loss of the offseason was the Davante Adams trade to Las Vegas, but the Packers will be getting back 2020 All-Pros Jaire Alexander and David Bakhtiari after both missed most of the season due to injury. Instead of paying Adams, the Packers spent their money retaining key defensive players in Rasul Douglas, De'Vondre Campbell, and Preston Smith, while adding two first round rookies to Joe Barry's unit. Adding Sammy Watkins, 33rd overall pick Christian Watson, and 4th round camp stud Romeo Doubs might not fully replace the receiving void that Tae left, so look for running backs Aaron Jones and AJ Dillon to be key contributors in the passing game. Despite the Adams trade the Packers still look to be a formidable team with serious Super Bowl aspirations
7.	| [](/LAC) | Chargers | 	9-8	|	It's ""put up or shut up"" season for the Chargers. Having a top 5 QB on a rookie deal has allowed them to put together their best roster since the mid-2000's. While the division is loaded, the other teams are also undergoing various levels of retooling. This will be their best opportunity for a while.  Carpe diem.
8.	| [](/SF) | 49ers | 	10-7	|	The 49ers come into the 2022 season with one of the most talented rosters in the league. The intrigue of the season revolves around second year starting QB Trey Lance. While Shanahan is known for tailoring and offense around the QB’s strengths, the margin for error becomes paper-thin on a team whose goal is nothing short of a Super Bowl Run.
9.	| [](/BAL) | Ravens | 	8-9	|	Everyone knows what happened last year, but now that we've made a [virgin sacrifice](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34503193/baltimore-ravens-lose-poe-mascot-season-ending-drumstick-injury) to the injury gods, so we are praying that everyone returns safe and healthy. Of course, having Ronnie Stanley/JK Dobbins/Gus Edwards basically unable to play Week 1 puts a hamper on a lot of things, but the revitalized secondary mixed with the emergence of Bateman and preseason favorite Isaiah Likely gives us Ravens fans a lot to look forward to this year. Here's hoping a healthy Lamar can have his best year yet.
10.	| [](/IND) | Colts | 	9-8	|	There’s a lot to unpack with the Colts this season. After Wentz was shipped out to Maryland, the team acquired Matt Ryan to replace him. He’s now the team’s 5th different starting QB in five years. In addition, the team added veterans Yannick Ngakoue and Stephon Gilmore, which should be a pleasurable boost to Gus Bradley’s new defense. Fans are also eager to see if second-year players Kwity Paye, Dayo Odeyingbo, Michael Stratchan, and Kylen Granson will make the big-leap forward. Uncertainty is the word of the day. But at the very least, Matt Ryan should be much more consistent than Wentz, and hopefully his skills elevate the team’s young WR corps and utilize Jonathan Taylor much more effectively. Will the Colts win the Super Bowl? Maybe. If they do, I’ll order a pizza; and they don’t, I’ll eat out. Also, fuck Deshaun Watson.
11.	| [](/PHI) | Eagles | 	9-8	|	Quiet (and not-so-quiet) optimism surrounds the Eagles after a series of promising off-season moves, both in signing talented players and yeeting underperforming 21st overall picks.  The season ultimately hinges on a single player -  Jalen Hurts - and whether he can improve from last season and cement his permanent role as perennial starter for the franchise.
12.	| [](/DEN) | Broncos | 	7-10	|	Siemian, Lynch, Osweiler, Keenum, Flacco, Allen, Lock, Driskel, Rypien, Hinton, Bridgewater — and Russell Wilson. The $246 million dollar man. The boon. The promised land found after wandering in the wilderness. The light, the chosen one. No superlative is strong enough to express the feeling. No more forced QB competitions, no more talking up guys. A high-level quarterback who is an even better person. The Broncos got their QB, and they didn't sell their souls to do it. #LetsRide
13.	| [](/OAK) | Raiders | 	10-7	|	After a season filled with seemingly endless incidents, the Raiders are coming off a playoff appearance for only the 3rd time in the last 20 years. Now, Derek Carr, entering his 9th season in the NFL, and with his 6th head coach in that time, looks to lead the team back to the playoffs with his best friend and new weapon Davante Adams. The Raiders are looking to start the regular season the same way they ended it last year, with a win over the Chargers.
14.	| [](/TEN) | Titans | 	12-5	|	The Titans go into the 2022 season a much different team than the #1 seed that was one and out in the playoffs.  The roster has changed in ways to get younger and try to prolong the 6 year streak of above .500 records.  The biggest move of the offseason was the AJ Brown trade with the bet being that the large AJ Brown contract would be too much in comparison to taking a shot on a first round WR (Treylon Burks).  Derrick Henry returns at full strength, the secondary has become deep with talent and Jeffery Simmons anchors a line that should make an impact even with the loss of Harold Landry.  The Titans may not be on the top level of a stacked AFC but Vrabel has proven that his coaching and approach can make the Titans out perform their collected talent.
15.	| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | 	12-5	|	Not gonna lie: the first month is gonna be rough. The Cowboys are entering the season with some injury issues, and they face 3 of the last 4 Super Bowl teams in the first 5 weeks. However, a weak division and a softer second half schedule leaves this team with a pretty decent path to the playoffs.
16.	| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | 	11-6	|	Is it already that time of the year again? Time to be full of hope, joy, and elation as our very own Arizona Football Cardinals take the field and provide electric offense alongside passable at times defense? Oh golly-wait, what is that in the distance?! Don't tell me it's… week 10 and onwards collapse!! Not again!!
17.	| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | 	9-8	|	We enter the 2022 season continuing our dynasty of offseason championships notching our 4th championship over the past 9 years. We're really hoping these offseason championships can finally translate to regular season success, more specifically, playoff success. Our offseason ""success"" seems to be inversely correlated to our playoff success considering we now own the second longest playoff win drought in the NFL (21 years.) We arguably have the most talented roster we've ever had since our last playoff win so let's hope we finally break the drought. For the first time in forever, we were unanimously picked by NFL Network to beat the Pats week 1. So naturally we're going to get blown out 38-10 and five of our players will suffer season ending injuries.
18.	| [](/NO) | Saints | 	9-8	|	New year, who dis? The Saints start 2022 with a new head coach for the first time in the power rankers era. Eschewing any inclination to chase a QB, they've stuck with Jameis in the hopes he bounces back from his injury last year - possibly a decent gamble given how he was looking before he went down.
19.	| [](/NE) | Patriots | 	10-7	|	Mac Jones has two favorite poems: “Man in the Arena” by Teddy Roosevelt, and “If” by Rudyard Kipling. The first is about how talk is cheap, and the person who matters is the one risking defeat to taste victory. The second is about the power of maintaining integrity and focus on what is most important.  There’s a lot of doom and gloom on talk radio around New England lately, and the buzzards are circling to feast on the corpse of the dynasty. You know who seems to still be smiling and enjoying life, though? Bill Fucking Belichick. There are plenty of reasons to lower expectations, but the games don’t happen on paper. Talk is cheap. The players on the field will determine the outcomes. Bill is staying true to who he is, and has his team focused on what they can control. Strap in.
20.	| [](/MIN) | Vikings | 	8-9	|	Kirk Cousins's career win-loss record is 59-59-2, so naturally when the Vikings' new management came in they... extended Kirk so they could run it back with this 8-9 squad? OK, so maybe the Vikings aren't clear contenders, but there's a vision here: Kevin O'Connell hopes to unlock Kirk the same way McVay once did in Washington, Justin Jefferson will feast on schemed-up matchups like Cooper Kupp and the offensive line might not even suck with [Christian Darrisaw drawing comparison to Trent Williams](https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1556397306768932866) and rookie Ed Ingram having a [standout preseason](https://twitter.com/NickOlsonNFL/status/1564606111034052610). The defense has talent, but that talent is either past its prime (Patrick Peterson, Harrison Smith, even Eric Kendricks) or comes with big injury concerns (Danielle Hunter & Za'Darius Smith). So there's a good reason Vegas right now projects this as another .500 squad, but there are also reasons to believe this team can beat those odds.
21.	| [](/PIT) | Steelers | 	9-7-1	|	For the first time in many years, the Steelers are a true question mark entering the season. In the past, even when pessimism lingered in the background of an optimistic foreground, there was a solid idea of what the Steelers could potentially achieve. Although Pittsburgh had a solid preseason from a W/L perspective, many questions still remain. The team has to solidify in several key areas, such as QB and OL. Pessimism gives way to realism, which is that this team is starting over without Big Ben, Trubisky has to make the job his own. The fact that Mason Rudolph is still a backup for the Steelers and not on a different team says something about the confidence in either the position, the OL's ability to keep it healthy, or both.
22.	| [](/CLE) | Browns | 	8-9	|	It was a mess of an off season.  Never before have the Browns experienced a QB controversy like this.  With the signing of Watson the Browns went from loveable underdogs to possibly the most hated team in the entire league.  Pre-season performance aside everyone is watching the Browns to see if they can pull out of this nose dive and regain their soul.  The Browns will face Baker in Carolina week one.  
23.	| [](/CAR) | Panthers | 	5-12	|	For Matt Rhule, this is it. Under Rhule, the Panthers have finished with 5 wins each of the past two seasons, and in fact, ended last season with a worse winning percentage than in 2020. CMC hasn't been healthy for the majority of either of those seasons, but that doesn't stop Panthers fans from believing in the team motto. Keep Pounding. Whenever this season gets started, it's going to be with that motto in our minds. After Sam Mills' introduction into the Hall of Fame this year, the motto rings even more true as we try to find out footing as a team. Turnover at the QB position is the obvious sign to point to, but there's so much more than has changed under the hood than just Baker. Schematically, we've moved away from Joe Brady to a Ben McAdoo-led offense, brought Steve Wilks back, and tried to bolster the LB corps. To that end, this team looks, and feels, different than the previous two seasons. Starting with Baker, the team obviously is showing more swagger and attitude than there has been previously. On the field, it remains to be seen if that translates to wins, or if it just translates to more of what Panthers fans expect out of Matt Rhule: bluster. No matter what, this is a season of change for the Panthers and it's going to be interesting to see how it unfolds.
24.	| [](/WAS) | Commanders |	7-10	|	The Washington Red-- sorry, Football Te-- apologies once more, I mean of course, The Washington Commanders are set to make their debut. New name, new uniforms and a new QB in Carson Wentz who joke all you want, is actually still an upgrade at the position. Ron Rivera has a lot of pressure in year 3 of his rebuild to produce a winning record and while the offense will be seemingly improved, the defense under Jack Del Rio has been woeful at best and with no notable additions talent-wise it's hard to see how they take a step forward. The best thing going for this team is perhaps an easier schedule than the murderers row of QB's they faced in 2021. While everyone enjoys piling on and optimism is in Washington is in short supply, it's important to remember that this team remained in contention most of the season with a backup QB last year so who knows.
25.	| [](/DET) | Lions | 	3-13-1	|	The Lions come into this season off a 3-13-1 campaign that left more questions than answers. Dan Campbell's first year as ~~HMFIC~~ HC came with a lot of growth, as he had to demote last year's OC halfway through the season and take over play calling. The charismatic coach has spent this training camp doing his damndest to light a fire underneath his young team; now, we get to see how well the players respond. **Hot Seat**: Jared Goff. Last season he started slow, but finished strong. Now, he has all the support from the team, new weapons, and a healthy O-Line. It's 'put up or shut up' time - no more excuses.
26.	| [](/NYJ) | Jets | 	4-13	|	This is a huge year for the Joe Douglas front office. The Jets added a ton of talent this offseason, and Douglas's moves have been widely praised by the football cognoscenti. But in this league the fate of a franchise rests of the shoulders of QB1, and Zach Wilson has a ton to prove after a rookie years with more downs than ups. If Wilson takes a meaningful step forward, the Jets should be in a position to contend sooner rather than later. If he has another year like 2021, the Jets may be in the market for a new QB (along with a new GM and Head Coach).
27.	| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | 	3-14	|	Capping off a less than electric camp, the Jags and fans alike look towards the 2022 season with renewed hope and equally high expectations compared to where they were a year ago. While the name on the building remains the same, the faces around the office are decidedly different than the season prior. Doug Pederson looks to replicate the success he had in Philadelphia, this time instead leading a crew of cats (rather than birds) to the promised land. Pederson's plans are tied directly to the anticipated growth of Jacksonville's 2021 1st overall pick, Trevor Lawrence. All eyes are firmly fixed on the sophomore QB as expectations catch up to the hype surrounding him. With a spread of only +3, the Duval squad looks to start the season strong, by heading to Washington and defeating the freshly christened Commanders.
28.	| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | 	7-10	|	Did anything crazy happen this offseason? I legitimately do not remember. Ooohhhhhhhh yeah! DK re-signed!! That's all that matters 😍. Week 1 is our Super Bowl on this season-long quest for #1 overall. Can Geno and Drew successfully tank command the Seahawks? We shall see.
29.	| [](/NYG) | Giants | 	4-13	|	2021 was... not kind to the Giants. They lost a number of starters to injury, Kenny Golladay pulled the emergency brake on his hype train in record time, and the team was being run by one of the most incompetent HC/GM duos the league had ever seen. 2022 is about righting the wrongs that have left this franchise in the sorry state it currently finds itself. For the first time in a long time, fans can have some actual hope, because a GM and HC who were hired on pedigree and not narcissism have started to commit to the rebuild this roster has so desperately needed for the last half a decade. There have been some painful moves, like the release of fan favorites James Bradberry and Blake Martinez, but the team also made some exciting additions through the draft. In what truly is Daniel Jones' make or break year, the front office has done everything within their limited resources to surround him with the best talent they can. Now it's time to see how it all translates on the field.
30.	| [](/CHI) | Bears | 	6-11	|	Things can change quickly in the NFL, and in just a few months Ryan Poles' has turned over two-thirds of the Bears' roster. The Bears' near and medium-term future still revolve entirely around Justin Fields. If Fields can take a step forward in his sophomore year, the Bears could make some noise in a fairly weak division.
31.	| [](/HOU) | Texans | 	4-13	|	This time last year I compared the Texans to East Germany in 1949; rebuilding but towards a future where there was no certainty that things would get better. This year the coming season feels far less bleak. The o-line is better, we have exciting young talent, and our QB isn't a rapist. Hope is in the air, and Kool-Aid is being served double-cupped on Kirby.  
32.	| [](/ATL) | Falcons | 	7-10	|	Week one. Saints vs Falcons, Winston vs Mariota. A rivalry opener in the real Mercedes Benz Stadium could set the tone for the season. Mariota might not have the arm his supporters hope for, and (if) Ridder plays there will be times he looks like a third-round rookie. Regardless, it's clear Dean Pees and Arthur Smith have a vision for this team, and through the draft and bargain-bin free agency shopping, Terry Fontenot is seeing that vision through. On the field, The Falcons will hopefully prove to be well coached, no matter how talent or untalented they look on paper. A relatively tough schedule might be the nail in the coffin of the Falcons 2022 season, nipping positivity in the bud. With 130 million in 2023 cap space, baby steps are fine heading in the right direction.",NFLPowerRankers,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/x7ha39/official_rnfl_week_0_power_rankings/,/r/nfl/comments/x7ha39/official_rnfl_week_0_power_rankings/,650,2022-09-06 18:01:28,495,,False,0.92,Power Rankings,2022-09-10 16:13:00.230789

AmItheAsshole,x79jom,AITA for not paying up?,"Background - I am a former college football player who had a cup of tea in the NFL and another pros sport. 

I currently own a small business and work side by side with my employees every day and we have a close relationship. One day one of my employees, who never played in the NFL or College, said he could beat me in a foot race. We marked off 100 meters in the parking lot and had a race for $1000. During the race, right when I was going to turn on the jets and gadoosh the guy, both of my hamstrings tore simultaneously (because, life man). Luckily I heal quickly like wolfereen and was able to run in the tough mudder 8 days later but it was dicey dicey for a bit.

I wasn’t able to finish the race, so I didn’t feel it was fair for me to have to pay the bet. He quit my business a few weeks later, really screwing me by leaving me with only an employee who is past the age of retirement (and has some weird accusations against him which I try to ignore) and one who goes on long, meaningless rants all the time to prove his intelligence.

### Patents

Revlon has applied for and received loads of patents over the years. Since 1976 Revlon has been granted 525 total patents. I have not gone through all of the patents but for the curious you can view them [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=revlon&tbs=ptss:g,sbd:1&tbm=pts&ei=IX4WY-KuLcav0PEPqdGFsAY&start=0&sa=N&ved=2ahUKEwiiw_mw3_75AhXGFzQIHaloAWY4UBDy0wN6BAgBEE0&biw=1330&bih=1304&dpr=1) and [here](https://patents.justia.com/assignee/revlon). 

If Revlon has existed since 1932 why did I choose patents since 1976 and not patents since 1932? Glad you asked! 1976 is the cutoff date for querying patents from The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) online database. Patents awarded before 1976 are discoverable but currently exist in [archived text catalogs](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/ptrc-patents-belonging-person-or-organization) since they are no longer legally enforceable and have low material relevance for most people today. 

Utility patents last 20 years and design patents last 15 years from the date of grant. Again I did not go through all of Revlon's patents but assuming only enforceable patents (last 15 years to cover my bases since patents could be either utility or design patents) Revlon has 62 known currently enforceable patent grants with the latest patent being granted August 16, 2022. 

In short, Revlon has a long history of innovation and they take their business edge seriously by protecting their intellectual property with patents. 

## 2. Ownership and Leadership 

### Ronald Perelman

Ron Perelman (referred to as RP from here forward) is the majority stakeholder of Revlon. His holding company MacAndrews & Forbes, of which he is the beneficial owner, Chairman, and CEO, owns 85.2% (46,223,321 shares) of Revlon class A common stock. RP has [regularly purchased shares for years without selling off any large pieces](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=REV&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=0&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&xs=1&xa=1&xd=1&xg=1&xf=1&xm=1&xx=1&xc=1&xw=1&excludeDerivRelated=1&vl=&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1). RP is currently 79 years old and Revlon is one of his last remaining holdings.

#### Notable RP Quotes

- RP admires Wal-Mart (the largest retailer of Revlon products):
  [On Wal-Mart in 2011] ""They have made, single-handedly, America more efficient.""
- RP likes putting capital to work:
   [In 1985 on the Revlon takeover] ""I can put my hands on $2 billion and I am going to spend it.""
- RP thinks long-term and broad market:
  [In 1985, the year he acquired Revlon] ""I think we’ve defined a strategy of seeking out companies with certain basic common characteristics. They’re all basic cash-flow generators, where the cash flow is free from fad, fashion, or styles… We won’t look at fashion companies. We won’t look at retailing chains like Macy’s. We won’t look at anything that’s high-tech-oriented or fad-oriented."" 
- RP loves his family:
  ""If someone comes into your house and does fucked-up things to your kids and your wife, you’re going to be capable of things you never imagined. Because it’s in there. It might be lying dormant, but it’s there."" 

#### RP Likes Business 

Throughout his career and ventures RP has acquired and sold numerous companies, many of which yielded sizable profits. His general strategy was to buy a company, sell off superfluous divisions, focus on the core business then sell it off or hold it for cash flow. In some instances he utilized leverage buyouts or hostile takeovers to get what he wanted. Some of his notable business acquisitions are:

- MacAndrews & Forbes
- Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd.
- Technicolor Inc.
- Compact Video
- New World Entertainment
- Four Start Television
- Marvel Comics 

Given RP's strategy of hostile takeovers and leveraged buy-outs, his acquisition of Revlon followed the same playbook. The company's divisions were fractured and sold and the company was placed under a large debt load immediately after acquisition. Revlon is no stranger to carrying and managing debt. It has grown and expanded over the decades, acquired outside companies, and launched thousands of products since RP bought it out.  

### Debra Perelman

Debra Perelamn (will **not** be referred to as DP from here forward… because she classy) is the CEO and President of Revlon. She is the daughter of RP and likely successor of Revlon's primary ownership. Debra became CEO of Revlon in 2018 after serving as the COO and being on the board of directors since 2015.

### Actions Speak Louder Than Words

It is my belief that RP wants to leave Revlon Inc. as his legacy to his daughter. RP has: 

- Experience in hostile takeovers of several companies (and knows how to defend against them)
- Continually purchased and held shares without sale
- Sold off personal affects to pay debtors before ever touching any of his Revlon stake 
- Fervently purchased shares throughout 2018 and 2019 while Debra was fresh at the helm of CEO
- Sold off other large stakes in hist portfolio as he's grown older but kept and increased his Revlon position
- Directly included Debra in leadership of the company since 2015 first with a board seat, then COO, then CEO

## 3. Recent Performance (2018-2021)

The years selected encapsulate not only the recent trajectory and performance of Revlon, but additionally capture the performance of the company under leadership of CEO and President Debra Perelman. The following sections are all a snapshot of company performance and news as of December 31st of each calendar year. 

### [2018 Annual Report Highlights](https://investors.revlon.com/static-files/adeabe36-437f-4661-8fe9-316ef5b8a43a)

- Assets: 3,120.9 million, liabilities: 4,210.3 million, cash and cash equivalents: $97.1 million

It should be no surprise that 2020 and 2021 impacted business performance. Everyone getting a free pass to wear pajamas and cover their face for two years didn't help sell Revlon's products. Supply chain disruptions and closures around the world also didn't help. Despite the setbacks of the last few years, Revlon has been making progress in some of their long-term goals. They continued to increase their e-commerce sales, opened direct-to-consumer boutique stores, launched new brands, acquired new patents, and continued to move forward in an uncertain world.

## 4. The Bankruptcy 

The elephant in the room. Revlon and its debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 15th, 2022 and the filing was accepted June 16th, 2022. Proceedings and actions immediately began. 

It is important to note that a bankruptcy filing is not always a death sentence to a company. Some notable examples of companies that filed for bankruptcy and recovered are: Kodak, American Airlines, Marvel Entertainment, Ally Financial, Hertz, and everyone's favorite pizza place - Sbarro. 

There are effectively two different types of bankruptcy filings, liquidation and reorganization. When most people hear bankruptcy they think personal bankruptcy (Chapter 7) which ends in liquidation of assets and discharge of remaining debts. Corporate bankruptcy fillings (Chapter 11) give companies time to delay payment to creditors and reorganize. Judge David Jones, the presiding judge in Revlon's bankruptcy case, has ordered a schedule for Revlon to exit bankruptcy by [April 2023](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/revlon-gets-court-approval-14-billion-bankruptcy-loan-2022-08-01/). They have time to get back on track but need to move swiftly. 

### Revlon's Statement to Stakeholders

From Revlon's [10-Q, filed on August 9th, 2022](https://investors.revlon.com/static-files/93766a90-5c32-4641-a50a-6ce40685e325): 

""The Chapter 11 Cases were necessitated primarily by, among other things, the impact of rising global inflation and global supply chain issues, which accelerated in mid-May 2022 and led to a liquidity shortfall. As disclosed in the Debtors’ filings in the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company is currently unable to timely fill almost one-third of customer demand for its products, due to an inability to source a sufficient and regular supply of raw materials. As a result of the liquidity shortfall and an inability to obtain out-of-court financing, the Company was unable to meet its obligations under its debt instruments and consequently voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 15, 2022.""

Sounds to me like it wasn't falling demand for products but rather supply chain disruptions that threw them off kilter. Let's see what they can do!

### Timeline of Bankruptcy Court Case

## 5. NYSE Delisting Notice

As a result of the bankruptcy filling, NYSE took immediate action and filed to begin the process of delisting Revlon from the exchange. On June 16th, 2022 NYSE commenced delisting proceedings against Revlon [citing “uncertainty” as their primary concern](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220616005662/en/NYSE-to-Commence-Delisting-Proceedings-against-Revlon-Inc.-REV) with the company. The announcement came almost immediately after the bankruptcy filing was accepted on June 16th. 

### The Delisting Process

Getting notice of a delisting from NYSE does not mean a company's fate is sealed and that they will wither into oblivion. There is a process that NYSE follows for delisting:

- Notice is sent to company that they are at risk of delisting and must respond within 10 business. 
- If company fails to reply in a timely manner delisting process begins following the 10th business day. The exchange then sets a delisting date and the trading is suspended thereafter. 
- If the company responds within 10 business days a hearing date with the exchange is set. 
- If the company meets listing requirements at the hearing, and NYSE believes they will continue to do so into the future, the company may remain listed. 
- The exchange will then track company performance to ensure listing requirements are met and the financial position of the company is stable and improving in cases of bankruptcy filings. 

### Revlon's Response to Delisting

Revlon responded to the NYSE notice of delisting in a timely manner (within 10 business days of notice). Following the response  NYSE has set a hearing date for Revlon to present its current standings and plan forward. NYSE will make a determination from materials presented if Revlon will remain on the exchange. Revlon has disclosed that the hearing date is scheduled for Thursday, October 13th, 2022, [found on their form 10-Q page 59](https://investors.revlon.com/static-files/93766a90-5c32-4641-a50a-6ce40685e325). 

## 6. Revlon's Recent Actions

While it is true Revlon has filled Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is at risk of being delisted from the NYSE, evidence suggests they are actively taking steps to continue operations, work through this troubling time, and retain their listing. Here are some of my findings. 

### Current Job Postings

- Revlon currently has [120 full-time job openings]( https://recruiting.ultipro.com/REV1000/JobBoard/417e03eb-b841-41ad-4a9a-8258fd438487/?q=&o=postedDateDesc) as of the time of this writing (9/4/2022).
- 67 of the 120 current openings, 55.8%, were posted **after** filing for bankruptcy with listings as current as Friday, September 2nd.
- [7 open roles for executive management level](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/REV1000/JobBoard/417e03eb-b841-41ad-4a9a-8258fd438487/?q=&o=postedDateDesc&f5=F0WKGUTgukOQFy1dhNzXAg), 5 of which were posted **after** the bankruptcy filing. The positions posted after filing consist of marketing managers across several brands/product segments.  
- [21 roles for department management level](https://recruiting.ultipro.com/REV1000/JobBoard/417e03eb-b841-41ad-4a9a-8258fd438487/?q=&o=postedDateDesc&f5=mqy3srKX60KV2JMhACpgbQ) 20 of which were posed **after** the bankruptcy filing. Positions include: IT, procurement, supply chain, HR, audit, marketing, finance, and product development.

These postings could be indicative of employee turnover and attrition or they could be part of the company's restructuring and plan forward to recover from bankruptcy. If the company was planning to go kaput or simply accepted defeat would they be actively hiring and on-boarding talent or would they simply wither and die? Continued hiring with posts as recent Friday last week are a sign, to me, that Revlon is continuing to move forward. 

### Shedding Costly Obligations

- Exited leases from 200 Park Avenue South of 46,000 square feet (for Revlon) and 36,000 square feet (for Elizabeth Arden, a subsidiary of Revlon). [The leases terminations are expected to save the company $17 million](https://therealdeal.com/2022/09/01/revlon-released-from-200-park-avenue-south-leases/). 
- There is also a [15-year lease (expires 2029) for 108,000 square feet at One New York Plaza](https://therealdeal.com/2014/03/05/revlon-grabs-92k-square-feet-at-1-new-york-plaza/) that the company may also look to exit. They are currently paying a rate of $70 per square foot. Exiting this lease may be a large windfall and help shed outstanding obligations further. 

### Secured Financing

On August 1st, 2022 Revlon got approval from the bankruptcy court for a 1.4 billion loan for restructuring and continued operations from BrandCo. Revlon and BrandCo. have a previous business relationship and BrandCo has provided lending facilities to Revlon in the recent past. 

## 7. Stock Things

### Warrants 

There are outstanding warrants listed on the [424B3 SEC filing from October, 31st 2016](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/890547/000156761916003137/s001445x4_424b3.htm#tTEO). The terms of the warrants are stated as: 

- 2,452,267 total share purchase of Series A Preferred Stock (pg. F-132)
- The exercise price is $20.39 with a maturity of August 19th, 2024 (pg. F-134)
- After August 19th, 2019 warrants can be exercised if the volume weighted average sales price of common stock exceeds a price of 150% of the exercise price ($30.585) for 10 consecutive trading days.

To date, Revlon has not issued any preferred stock so these warrants do not appear to have been exercised. It is also difficulty to track these warrants as they were exempt from registration requirements at the time of filing: ""The issuance and sale of the Preferred Stock and Warrants were exempt  from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, pursuant to  Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act."" (pg. F-132)

We will be able to see if the warrants were exercised indirectly by checking price action and the tape after the stock trades above $30.58 for 10 consecutive days. It's not a huge concern for now, but something to be mindful of going into the future. 

### Potential Dilution

Shares outstanding have remained relatively stable over the last decade slightly increasing from ~52 million shares to 54.28 million shares today. The majority of the recent increase in shares outstanding were RSU's distributed via the employee stock plan along with a [$25 million at the money offering from Revlon in April of this year](https://investors.revlon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/revlon-announces-market-equity-offering-program). Overall, shares outstanding have been stable and have not expanded or contracted significantly for the last decade.

As of June 30th, 2022 per Revlon's [10-Q SEC filing on August 9th, 2022](https://investors.revlon.com/static-files/93766a90-5c32-4641-a50a-6ce40685e325)

- Shares outstanding: 54,281,651
- Shares held by RP: 46,223,321

The public float, as reported by Revlon on their [investor relations page](https://investors.revlon.com/financial-information/fundamentals/trading-statistics) is 3.21 million shares. I am unsure of when this was lasted updated so we can use the numbers above to get the maximum float for certain:  54,281,651 (total outstanding) - 46,223,321 (RP's stake) = 8,085,330 shares. This number does not factor in any other market participants such as ETFs, institutions, or insiders. I'll say it again for those in the back… **Maximum Float of 8,085,330 Shares**.

Revlon also has the following capital stock authorizations: 

- 900,000,000 shares of Class A common stock (approved, 54,281,651 issued)
- 200,000,000 shares of Class B common stock (approved, not issued )
- 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock (approved, not issued)

No preferred stock or Class B stock has been issued by the company thus far. Only Class A common stock currently exists. If the timing and price is right, Revlon will likely look to sell shares to clear some (or all) of their debt and gain operating capital to get them back on their feet. They have the room in their stock authorizations to issue more shares and have shown they are willing do so with the at the money offering earlier this year. 

Even with a potential dilution on the table we know that RP likes owning a large protective stake in the company. Based on previous actions I assume RP wishes to maintain this stake to protect the company, especially in these vulnerable times. To retain voting control of the company RP needs to maintain a positing of 51% of shares outstanding (although I'd bet he wants to maintain far in excess of that). 

Assuming a move to dilute RP to 51% (the minimum for him to retain majority control) the total float would be (46,223,321/0.51) = 90,663,962 total outstanding shares. Subtracting current shares from maximum potential dilution (90,663,962 - 54,281,651) gives a total of 36,382,311 of possible dilute shares before RP loses his majority control. I do not think the company will move to sell this many shares unless it can clear all outstanding debts (~5 billion in total) outright. For fun, lets calculate what that share price would be:  5,000,000,000/36,382,311 = $137.43  Assuming RP is willing to take dilution of his stake down to 51%, the company could sell 36,382,311 shares at $137.43 and clear all of their debt. A lofty price indeed. 

Do keep in mind that at the money share offerings are absolutely on the table but for them to be massively worth it, both to RP and the company, the share price has a long way up to go. In short, I have no major concern about a large dilution until the trading price is much, much higher as they have already secured a loan of 1.4 billion to cover continued operations and satisfy immediate obligations.

### RegSho

Revlon was put on NYSE RegSho on June 22nd, 2022 where it remained consecutively until August 1st, 2022. Price action on these dates was significant. I urge you to go look at the chart those days to see for yourself. Low liquidity + buying = dramatic price improvement. Remaining on RegSho for such a long period of time is indicative of low liquidity in the underlying stock: first to generate enough FTDs *consistently* to get on RegSho then second, taking over a month to clear outstanding FTD obligations (and still not clearing all of them) ultimately ending in forced clearing on August 1st to get Revlon off of RegSho. 

### Buy-Ins

You can check all of the changes in institutional share holdings of Revlon as of June 30th, 2022 [here](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rev/institutional-holdings). Keep in mind there is a delay in the reporting and shares could have been traded at any time during Q2 (April 1st through June 30th, 2022). The positions are following Q2 13-F filings and the current share ownership as of June 30th, 2022. 

As of the end of Q2 the following large institutions have disclosed a new or increased holding in Revlon:

- Morgan Stanley - 400,650 additional shares (total of 422,998 held)
- Clear Street - 330,174 shares 
- Marshall Wace, LLP - 301,758 shares 
- Jane Street Group, LLC - 125,356 additional shares (total of 135,937 held)
- Cubist Systematic Strategies, LLC - 113,867 shares

Counting all position increases and buy-ins reported on June 30th there were: 

- 33 institutions that opened a new position or increased a current position
- 2,001,844 shares reported as owned with 1,330,682 shares newly acquired

### Sell-Offs

Looking at the same data as buy-ins (Q2 13-F filings) we can see seller activity (likely spurred by the bankruptcy announcement): 

- 31 institutions completely sold out of their Revlon position totaling 1,881,030 shares 
- 14 institutions reducing their position totaling 1,228,654 shares sold (retained 1,478,529 shares in total)

Due to the timing of the filings it is not possible to know the exact transaction dates. Many of the sales were likely due to the bankruptcy announcement. Purchases however could have been conducted after Revlon filled for bankruptcy. If these purchases were between June 15th (bankruptcy filing) and June 30th (quarter end) I bet they see some serious potential in their investments and are betting on a turn around plan (perhaps even a squeeze?). Every institution that reported ownership of Revlon shares as of June 30th knew about the bankruptcy for at least 15 calendar days… and they still held or upped their position before filing there 13-F's. Bullish.

### June 30th Snapshot 

Okay we can deduce a few things (as of June 30th) from the numbers presented in this ""Stock Things"" section: 

- Shares outstanding: 54,281,651
- Shares held by RP: 46,223,321
- Shares held by buyers: 2,001,844
- Shares retained by sellers: 1,478,529
- Free float based on above numbers: 4,577,957 (not counting retail, ETFs, or options hedging)

Do keep in mind that positions can change on a daily basis and these numbers are merely a snapshot in time to highlight the low free float of Revlon in recent times. That said the free float is looking pretty small.

## 8. The Options Chain

The options chain is something to behold. Anyone who's taken a look through it knows there is some serious upside potential in the chain if the underlying price of Revlon starts moving higher. While there isn't a solid gamma ramp built up (so far) there are intriguing numbers in the options greeks. If the price moves higher and as attention increases I expect a gamma ramp to fill out and prepare for launch. 

### The Chain as of Today (9/5/2022)

- Open Call Interest: 108,614 total call contracts
  - Shares to be hedged based on current delta at each strike: 3,834,794
- Open Put Interest: 51,852 total put contacts
  - Shares to be hedged based on current delta at each strike: -959,355
- Call hedging less Put hedging: 2,875,439 shares should be currently held to maintain a delta neutral position of all currently open contracts. 

Note: The data I have access too does not specify which contacts are covered calls/covered puts. Many of these options could be covered calls or cash secured puts from people looking to collect premium along the way. Additionally, options positions can change rapidly. I will try to provide weekly updates of this data from here forward but the chain as it stands is very intriguing and puts the lead in my pencil if you know what I mean.

## 9. What About… FTDs, Price Targets, and TA? 

There are lots of other pieces of info in the pickle jar, stream clips, and across this sub as well as on /r/revlong for this info. This DD is long as hell already and I'm running out of steam. The purpose was to give more of a fundamental analysis of Revlon, its history, ownership, performance, current happenings, and upcoming significant dates. 

## 10. Let's Recap (aka TL;DR)

- Revlon is a company with a large portfolio of brands and a rich history. Their name alone is valuable, they have been granted loads of patents, and their products are sold around the world. You and most of the people you know have probably bought a Revlon product in the last year. 
- RP, the largest shareholder, has diamond hands and doesn't like to sell. He's getting older (79), loves his family, and is the type of guy that wants to leave a legacy. His daughter is the current CEO and president of Revlon and likely successor of RP's stake. He's sold off personal affects in years past but has not touched any of his Revlon position. He likes the stock. 
- RP is no stranger to leveraged buy-outs and maintains the majority control of the company, most likely to defend against outsiders from taking over the company, ie how he acquired Revlon in 1985. 
- Revlon has filed for bankruptcy but appears to want to continue kicking despite this setback. They are still hiring, shedding expensive leases, and got approval for a 1.4 billion dollar loan to continue operations. 
- Revlon meets with NYSE on October 13th, 2022 for their delisting hearing. If the company presents a solid case along with a plan (who gets 1.4 billion without a plan?!) they may remain listed on NYSE.
- Morgan Stanley and others bought a sizable chunk of shares *and held them* after Revlon declared bankruptcy and was given a delisting notice. If the company remains listed I expect other institutions and ETFs will also buy back in. 
- The float is small and liquidity is drying up. It wouldn't take much interest to launch this thing into space. 
- The options chain is being priced for explosive movement and as it starts moving we could get a gamma squeeze that will rip this thing to prices unknown.
- Revlon has until April 2023 to exit bankruptcy or be dissolved. It's do or die, and I think they doin'. 

## 10. My Thoughts and Speculation

Everything from here forward are my own thoughts and opinions. Make your own decisions and form you own options from the data provided. 

Revlon appears to have a plan from the outside looking in. They are cutting costs, repositioning, continuing to seek talent, and working to move forward through the bankruptcy process. They are responding regularly and timely to any and all filings and proceedings. The company immediately took action once the bankruptcy hit the tape and began first day actions along with responding to the NYSE to remain listed. Nobody in their right mind would lend a dying company 1.4 billion dollars without a clear plan forward and the a solid belief to recoup that capital. All of these actions lead me to believe Revlon is willing to fight for survival. 

Ownership and leadership in the company are solid and have been for decades. RP has hands made of crystalized carbon and does not sell, he only buys, and has for decades. RP is well versed in corporate takeovers and leveraged buy-outs and is unlikely to fall victim to them. He holds the vast majority of Revlon, likely to defend against hostile takeovers, and knows the tricks of the trade for corporate financing to take a company over. RP loves his family, is creeping up in age, and his daughter is running the largest and most notable acquisition of his career. I believe RP wants Debra to succeed and leave a legacy behind for her to run and potentially pass on to her children. 

I do not think Revlon will be delisted from NYSE. The date is a little under six weeks out, and things can change, but I believe they have a solid case to remain listed and work their way through bankruptcy. They have until April 2023 to turn it around and have already hit the ground running on day 1.  


**TL;DR of my TL;DR:** 

Revlon appears to have a plan. I don't think they will get delisted. Liquidity is dryer than the Sahara, the float is tiny, RP has diamond hands, and pressure is being applied to Revecca's skenes's glands… build enough friction and pressure and she finna squart. Options greeks are insane and this thing has the potential for serious upside. It's already bankrupt so it can't go to double bankruptcy (simple math says two negatives cancel out and make a positive). 

There are no guarantees in life and this thing could also go to $0. Make your own choices, I am not your Dad. I will see you beautiful briney bastards in the pickle jar. I like the stock.

u_runbearing,x6youe,The total for High quality small bearing is currently sitting," [Non standard bearing](http://www.runbearing.com/product-high-precision-manufacture-6203zz-30115.html) is the right coach to orchestrate this Bear offensive as they do not have a true go to player. The receiving core consists of Devin Hester, Earl Bennet and Johnny Knox while they will have a running back combination in Matt Forte and Chester Taylor who was brought over form the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears success on offense will have to come by a controlled distribution of the ball and Martz will put Cutler in good situation to do so.

&#x200B;

The defense which will be solid with the addition of Julius Peppers and big play defenders in Lance Briggs, Hunter Hillenmeyer, Brian Urlacher and tackle Tommie Harris. The Bears laid it on the line this off season spending fifty-five million dollars in guaranteed money while changing both their offensive and defensive coordinators. Our NFL experts for NFL picks predict that if Peppers can bring his 10 ½ sacks or better this year, the Bears investment will pay off and they will get back to the playoffs for the first time since 2006.

The Buffalo Bills climbed back up to the .500 mark with a 17-12 home win over the Minnesota Vikings last week. In order to get over that mark this weekend theyll have to do what no other team has been able to this season beat the Chicago Bears.

&#x200B;

The Bears ran roughshod over the Seattle Seahawks in the Sunday Night game last week getting two touchdown passes from Rex Grossman and two touchdown runs from Thomas Jones in the 37-6 victory. Chicago easily covered the spread at home versus Seattle and now sit at 3-1 against the spread ATS on the season.

&#x200B;

Buffalo is also 3-1 ATS in 2006 thanks to their win over Minnesota last week. Bills quarterback J.P. Losman went 23-of-32 for 222 yards passing versus the Vikings with one touchdown and no interceptions. Willis McGahee ran for a score for Buffalo and Peerless Price had the teams TD catch.

&#x200B;

To improve that ATS mark today the Bills need to keep the score close. Oddsmakers at Pinnacle Sports have the unbeaten Bears pegged as large 11.5 point +106 bet $100 to win $106 home favorites for the 1:00pm ET contest versus Buffalo. The Bears are 2-0 ATS at home this season and 3-1 ATS as favorites. The Bills are 2-0 ATS on the road in 2006 and 2-0 ATS as the underdog.

&#x200B;

The total for  [High quality small bearing](http://www.runbearing.com/product-china-high-quality-ball-bearing-6000zz-10-26-8mm-30059.html) is currently sitting at 34 points. The combined score of last weeks Bills/Vikings game fell UNDER the posted total and Buffalo is 1-3 OVER/UNDER on the season. Chicago has a 2-1-1 OU mark in 2006 and the Bears almost single-handedly cashed the OVER against the Seahawks.

&#x200B;

The last time Buffalo and Chicago met in September 2002 the Bills came away with a 33-27 home victory as 3-point favorites. The combined score of that contest went OVER the days posted total. The Bears havent beaten the Bills since December 1997 when they came up with a 20-3 home victory as 1-point underdogs. And then there were three

sportsbook,x9yhfa,Rugby Picks Weekend 10th September,"Had a fair bit of success last season with a points algorithm System will leave some info here every Thursday and Friday. Just fun be responsible.

Top 14 Rugby 4 picks for a Lucky 15

Lyon (-2) vs La Rochelle 10/11

The first thing to note is that the home advantage in Top 14 is massive in Top 14 on average the home team will win by 8.84 points. Last season Lyon at home by an average of 12 points per game. La Rochelle were the best home team last season but lost away by an average of 5 so already for me the handicap is favouring Lyon. Lyon had a very impressive win away from home last week to Brive who are very good at home. Lyon have not done much in the market and their team is very similar to last season bar the loss of Barassi. As for La Rochelle a good 4 point win vs Montpeiller last week and some great additions such as Antonie Hastoy but a long season last season with a fair few changes in the squad they may find it hard down in Lyon

Perpingnan (-5) vs Brive 10/11

Perpignan had the 3rd worst home form in the Top 14 last year and won by an average 4.91 points. Played very well last week with a close loss to Pau. Brive with the worst away record in Top 14 last year losing by an average away by 21.

Castres (-6) vs Stade Français

Castres record at home last season was almost impeccable and won by an average of over 9 points. As for Stade Français they lost games away from home by an average of 13 points. They were lucky to beat Clermont last week. Castres were disappointing last week and I do have question marks over their last run in the post season last year but I can still see them winning here by more than 6.

Bayonne (+3) vs Racing 92

Bayonne is a special place for rugby, and after a year out of Top 14 where they dominated the Pro D2 I expect them to come out here fighting. Racing lost to Biarritz away last season and we shall see if they can put up the fight of Bayonne. When offered a plus on a home team in France I would usually bite their hand off added with Bayonne bring in the likes of Camille Lopez

sportsbook,x88b6o,Let's Talk About Teasers - NFL Week 1,"What's up everyone, if you are unfamiliar with this post or new to the subreddit, one of the things we love to take a look at each week here are the NFL betting lines that follow along with the betting strategies that Stanford Wong outlined for us regarding NFL Teasers. YES if you look below they don’t follow along exactly with how he set it out for us but I have done extensive research into the historical data and outlined the reasoning for how we do it here. 

If you are unfamiliar with Wong Teasers in general you can read the [week 1 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/) from u/blackjack_counter who has since deleted his Reddit. 

Or this [Wong Teaser Basics Article]( https://www.sportsgamblingpodcast.com/2022/08/01/degen-university-103-the-wong-teaser/
)I wrote over the summer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 6 Point Teasers

Our methodology for playing 6-point teasers is **similar** to Blackjack expert Stanford Wong's strategy:

- Tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, +2½, or +3

- Tease the favorite when the line is -7½, -8, -8½, or -9.

NOTE: The original Wong Criteria do not include +3 or -9 but this is how the post was done previously so we will continue to use them. Over the past 3 years it has only made a difference of about 1.5% to include those.


It is not recommended to tease game totals.


The reasoning behind this methodology is that games are frequently decided by a final margin of 3, 6, or 7. So we play teasers in such a manner that we gain these numbers in the teaser movement.


In the [week 1 post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/), u/blackjack_counter did a mathematical dive into whether we should be playing games at exactly +3, whether home teams are more reliable than road teams, and whether the total of the game matters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sweetheart Teasers

 10-point teasers are often called ""sweetheart"" teasers. Over the past three years, underdogs of +1½, +2, +2½ were 139-21 (86.88%).

After looking at a small sample size in 2017-2020, I've decided to track 10-point teasers according to the following methodology:

- For 10-point teasers, tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, or +2½;

- Take the favorite at -10 or -10.5

- Do not take sweetheart teasers at +3;

Reasoning: Over the past 3 years, favorites from -10 to -10.5 in a 10 point teaser have a record of 41-4 (91.1%) which is more than enough value to justify adding them to this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Week 1 Preview

**These are my opinions**

Overall, great season for Wong teasers in 2021, coming out at right about 90% hit rate for the full season on 6 point teasers. Looking forward to the 2022 season. Be sure to follow me here for each weekly update. Usually they will be on Wednesdays if there is a Thursday night game, or Fridays if there isn’t. 

Posting this a little early cause I am heading out of town but I will update this post on Sunday morning. Obviously, week 1 I probably have too many games that I will bet on. Taking a look at the lines that meet the Wong Teaser criteria right now, I will most likely be avoiding the Browns. Too much uncertainty surrounding the Panthers and the Browns as a whole. I really like the home dogs in the Cowboys and Vikings. The Vikings are a teaser dream for some reason and even more so now that Zimmer is out of there. I do like the Patriots as well if that line moves back to 3 by Sunday. I took a look and in the past 4 years the Patriots have never been a dog to the Dolphins and now we are getting 3 points? Yes I realize the Patriots won’t be super great this year but getting 9 points in a division game with Bill Belichik is a no brainer.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Week 1 Lines

For the purposes of tracking the results and staying consistent, I will continue to use Bovada's closing line. Please note that the results posted next week may differ from what is below due to line movement

This will show the total and the Record of that team as a 6pt teaser in the current situation this week. So if they’re an underdog, their record below will be their record as an underdog. The total is only on this chart so you can reference it. 

As of Wednesday morning, the unofficial list of Wong teasers this week are:

|**Wednesday Spread**|**Total**|**6pt Teaser Record since 2018**|**10pt**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Rams +2.5|52|7-3|9-1|
|Browns +1.5|41.5|7-3|7-2|
|Vikings +1.5|47|9-2|10-1|
|Cowboys +2.5|51|5-2|6-1|
|Jaguars +2.5|44|9-5|9-5|

# Historical Wong Teaser Records


*As of 09/13/21, the historical data has been standardized to the s3.sportsdatabase.com SDQL query for each teaser record. This yearly data report is run through that year’s regular season. This data excludes pushes. EX: Year 2018 data is collected from Week 1 to Week 17. 2021 season will be 18 weeks.


|**6 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--| :--|
|2018|+1½ thru +3|59-18|76.62%|
|2019|+1½ thru +3|52-18|74.29%|
|2020|+1½ thru +3|60-16|78.95%|
|2021|+1½ thru +3|67-17|79.76%|
|2018|-7½ thru -9|18-3|85.71%|
|2019|-7½ thru -9|13-4|76.47%|
|2020|-7½ thru -9|25-3|89.29%|
|2021|-7½ thru -9|24-5|82.76%|



|**10 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2018|+1½ thru +2½|35-3|92.1%|
|2019|+1½ thru +2½|35-5|87.5%|
|2020|+1½ thru +2½|34-6|85%|
|2021|+1½ thru +2½|36-3|92.3%|
|2018|-10 thru -10 ½|10-1|90.91%|
|2019|-10 thru -10 ½|10-3|76.92%|
|2020|-10 thru -10 ½|8-0|100%|
|2021|-10 thru -10 ½|13-0|100%|


Assuming a -120 payout for 2-team teasers, we must demonstrate better than 73.9% probability on each leg to show we have breakeven-or-better EV. **For a -130 payout on 3-team sweethearts, that threshold is 82.7%.** These are specifically for my book so yours may differ.

|**Teams**|**Odds**|**Implied Odds per Leg**|**Threshold**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2|-120|-282|73.8%|
|3|+150|-280|73.7%|
|4|+235|-283|73.9%|
|5|+350|-285|74%|
|6|+550|-273|73.2%|


Overall Weekly Records for 6pt teasers over the last 4 years (Week 18 is only 2021)

|**Week**|**Record**|**Win %**|
--|:--|:--|
|1|22-4|84.62%|
|2|17-3|85%|
|3|26-2|92.86%
|4|16-6|72.73%|
|5|19-4|82.61%|
|6|17-8|73.08%|
|7|15-6|68%|
|8|12-1|92.3%|
|9|17-3|85%|
|10|16-4|80%|
|11|14-8|63.64%|
|12|22-3|88%|
|13|17-4|80.95%|
|14|22-9|70.97%|
|15|18-4|81.82%|
|16|23-4|85.19%|
|17|9-7|56.25%|
|18|2-0|100%|

This shows that, historically, week 3 and 8 are the best weeks to bet these teasers for some reason.

# Original Criteria Results

3 years ago when this post started we have included +3 and -9 in the criteria. The Chart below is the results if you only played the original criteria outlined by Wong. Personally my guess as to what we will see here is the amount of games that meet the criteria will go down quite a bit and will result in a 1-2% win increase in the long run. But I could be completely wrong we will see!

|**Teaser**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|6 pt|+1 ½ thru +2.5|0-0|0%|
|6 pt|-7 ½ thru -8.5|0-0|0%|
|10 pt|+1 ½ thru +2 ½|0-0|0%|



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Regarding game totals < 49

The games with a total of 49 or less got brought up originally by u/blackjack_counter. In his week 1 post, he put:
>Do totals matter? Another word of advice that some Wong bettors give is to only play games with low totals. The idea certainly makes sense: points are harder to come by in a low-scoring game, so the 6-point tease is worth more. But what does the data say about this in the last three years?


From 2018-2021, here are the statistics including playoffs:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|234-65|78.26%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|177-50|77.97%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|36-13|73.47%|


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|76-15|83.52%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|60-11|84.5%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|12-1|92.3%|


If you wanted to look at only home favorites (Wong's original criteria is home favorites):


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|53-12|81.25%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|43-9|82.7%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|9-1|90%|


Although, u/blackjack_counter proved in his week 1 post that only betting home favorites for Wong teasers proved not to be necessarily a great bet.


Here is the results for 2022:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|0-0|0%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|0-0|0%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|0-0|0%|



|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|0-0|0%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|0-0|0%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|0-0|0%|

sportsbook,x5tu3h,Decent long shot future: betting an OL to win OROY?,"I realize this has never happened before, so perhaps voters literally just won’t let it. But I was doing some digging and the odds on the OT’s to win OROY are staggeringly low (like +12500) something comically insane. Again: maybe it’s literally impossible.

But we were told this is the worst draft class in decades. It’s highly unlikely there’s a Ja’Marr Chase or Justin Jefferson in this class. All these receivers either haven’t impressed in the preseason or are in less than ideal situations. Burks has apparently struggled, Wilson is like #3 headed into the season, Olave plays in a run heavy team with an up-and-down QB while competing with experienced WRs for targets, etc. 

The running backs aren’t looking much better. Hall is firmly his teams #2 right now, Ken Walker is as well. 

We don’t know if any of these QBs will get meaningful snaps. Puckett COULD, but we know he’s not starting yet.

Look, obviously someone will probably break out and win this award. But there were 3 top 10 OT’s (Ekwonu, Neal, Cross). If one of them has a standout rookie season like Rashawn Slater last year, could a big fella finally win this award? All three of these names are already firmly entrenched as starters.

Again: this is not be predicting this will happen. But as crazy as these odds are I may take a nibble. Am I crazy?",buzzcity0,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/x5tu3h/decent_long_shot_future_betting_an_ol_to_win_oroy/,/r/sportsbook/comments/x5tu3h/decent_long_shot_future_betting_an_ol_to_win_oroy/,13,2022-09-04 18:22:17,0,,False,0.5,NFL 🏈,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,x58pkr,Addicted and Heritage won’t delete account,"Been gambling since 2018, started as a way to make extra cash for parents medical bills and now I’m blowing all my money on random bets “trying to get it back”. I would change my password to something random but I always call heritage and change it back. I’m sick of it, I want out, I’m completely done with gambling. I’ve accepted I won’t get any of the money back but heritage keeps calling me and leaving voicemails every 2-3 days and essentially pulling me back in. I’ve expressed multiple times I want to close my account bc I have a problem controlling my gambling but they refuse to delete my account. Not sure what to do but it’s unethical how they’re abusing my addiction. I have screen shots of me telling them I’m addicted and want my account closed but they respond with its their policy to not delete accounts.",Primary-Platypus-904,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/x58pkr/addicted_and_heritage_wont_delete_account/,/r/sportsbook/comments/x58pkr/addicted_and_heritage_wont_delete_account/,64,2022-09-04 00:04:43,109,,False,0.87,Discussion 💬,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

Do these sportsbook syncing apps log in independently of when you log in?  My concern is that these apps log in on their own regularly and I will end up being banned from books for logging in from different locations than where I am at.  I have gotten my account suspended on Fanduel for this suspicion previously but I am not sure how it all works.

Also, has anyone had any issues with having their accounts hacked or other troubles after syncing them?

Any bets you like, either single game or tournament futures?

I’m liking Luka most total assists at +200. This is total assists, not average. So it requires a player who will both get a lot of assists each game, and advance far enough. His team is almost guaranteed a quarter final berth and should make the semifinal. If they lose semifinal they still play for third place after that.

sportsbook,x2ggch,Parlays are big business for sportsbooks — and big trouble for bettors,"    https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/08/31/sports-betting-parlay-odds/
    
    Parlays — propositions that combine multiple wagers, or “legs,” into one more extensive bet in hopes of turning a little money into a lot — have always been popular with the public. Regulated sportsbooks in the United States often promote such wagers, because oddsmakers know the advantage resides heavily with the house. (If even one individual leg doesn’t come through, the entire bet is a loser.)
    
    According to the University of Nevada’s Center for Gaming Research, the state’s sportsbooks earned, on average, 5.7 cents on every dollar wagered on football in 2021. They earned 5.5 cents on every dollar wagered on basketball and 4.8 cents on every dollar wagered on baseball.
    
    Parlays, however, resulted in a windfall of 32.1 cents per dollar, illustrating why so much of the advertising, promotional odds boosts and other marketing incentives from sportsbooks now revolve around parlays. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins told attendees at the Goldman Sachs Travel and Leisure Conference in June that his organization’s focus on parlays would further intensify.
    
    
    “What we are doing is trying to get smart at eliminating the sharp action or limiting [it] at least … and then also making sure that we have a high parlay mix because people do like that,” Robins said.
    
    
    Sportsbooks do so well on parlays because each of the individual bets need to win to cash the parlay. Lose one, and the whole wager is graded as a loss. How likely the parlay is to cash depends on the likelihood of each wager included. If you have two wagers that are each +100 — bet $100 to win $100 — then the parlay has roughly a 25 percent chance of winning. If those wagers are each -110 (bet $110 to win $100) the chances improve to 27 percent, but the payoff will also be slightly lower to reflect those odds.
    
    Where many bettors get in trouble is chasing big scores with multiple-legged parlays that often feel like a sure thing. A six-leg parlay in which each leg has odds of -233 — implying a 70 percent chance of winning each leg — may feel like a relatively safe bet. In reality, it has only about a 12 percent chance of winning.
    
    And in single-game parlays — an increasingly popular option in which bettors must select multiple bets from within the same game — you could get penalized for choosing wagers that are correlated, meaning there is a positive relationship between the bets that makes them more likely to be successful.
    
    Here’s an example from this baseball season. Let’s pretend we wanted to create a single-game parlay on FanDuel for a June game between the New York Mets and Milwaukee Brewers. We want to take over eight total runs, offered at -110 odds. We also want to add a Pete Alonso home run at +310 odds, giving us a single-game parlay with two wagers that will pay +485.
    
    But those two events are correlated. More home runs typically mean more runs scored. If we instead switch the run total bet to under eight runs, also at -110, but keep the Alonso home run prop — giving us two uncorrelated events in the same game — the potential return is bumped up to +980 despite the odds for each wager being exactly the same (+310 and -110). The fair value for this parlay, taking into consideration the prices of the two bets, is around +680. In other words, the correlated parlay is vastly underpaying bettors, while the uncorrelated parlay is overpaying. Not all sportsbooks penalize you in this way, so make sure you compare prices at different outlets.
    
    Single-game parlays could also have different rules, even for the same bet. On DraftKings, for example, if you place a straight wager on a player getting a hit in an MLB game, he has to start and record at least one plate appearance for the bet to be live. If that same wager is part of a single-game parlay, the player only needs a plate appearance. In other words, he could pinch hit later in the game for one at-bat and the bet would be considered live, an obvious disadvantage to the bettor.
    
    There are also situations in which the prices themselves are different for the same bet, depending on if it is used in a single-game parlay or not. Here is the exact same game offered on DraftKings both as straight wagers (top) and as part of a single-game parlay (bottom). There are different prices for the money line, run line and over/under totals, despite them being the same wagers. (Not all the differences are in a disadvantageous direction for bettors.)
    
    Then there are the odds “boosts” sportsbooks offer, many of which come via two- or three-leg parlays. Caesars this season offered to “boost” a two-leg parlay — which required Bryce Harper and Jorge Soler to each hit a home run in a game — to +1200, a juicy-sounding number. That same wager, however, could be had at +1846 odds at FanDuel using a single-game parlay without a boost. Sportsbooks, in other words, are selling a product — so don’t assume their enthusiasm around special parlay offers necessarily means they have any value for bettors.
    
    Finally, be wary of any promoted parlays. These typically involve a few favorites strung together to give the illusion of a short cut to a winning bet; clearly, that is far from the case. DraftKings promoted a parlay during the baseball season that included the Houston Astros winning (-180), the Atlanta Braves winning (-280) and no run being scored in the first inning of a Colorado Rockies-Arizona Diamondbacks game (-125). The promoted parlay offered +280 odds, but the fair-value price — based on the Pinnacle sportsbook, once you removed the vig — was +320. On paper, three bets at minus odds — which each should be favored to win — looks like a promising 3-0 ticket, but the math (and reality) is very different. Even if you had three overwhelming favorites at -250 odds each — implying a 71 percent win rate per leg — you would still only have a 36 percent chance of going 3-0.
    
    Are parlays a big winner for the house? Absolutely. Does this mean you should avoid them altogether? No. Just like any bet, if you believe you have an edge, you should bet accordingly. If you believe you have an edge in multiple games, then it makes sense to parlay those together for an increased payoff.
    
    But by impulsively betting parlays at every turn, you will be enriching the house more often than your own bankroll.",benjamindanielkatz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/x2ggch/parlays_are_big_business_for_sportsbooks_and_big/,/r/sportsbook/comments/x2ggch/parlays_are_big_business_for_sportsbooks_and_big/,141,2022-08-31 15:26:36,158,,False,0.92,Sportsbooks,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,x1t8wt,Weather impacting games,"Casual better here- I often find myself betting a game id like to watch only to turn it on to see its cold and rainy in (insert city). I am apart of a pool where the lines lock where they open. So potentially some value in watching the weather forecast and imo betting the under or taking the team with points more often (maybe this is flawed thinking). 

So my question is, is there any apps or data points that others follow to monitor weather, particularly bad weather. Or do I just need to follow like national weather patterns to bet this theory?

So an update, I received the free bets back on Thursday and have 1 week to use these free bets before they expire.

I'm trying to use them on major market lines to convert (NCAAF, Bundesliga, UFC, MLB etc) but can't ""Your request bet is over the allowed limit. The maximum stake has been adjusted for you to resubmit your bet"".

I've tried between +200 to +500 and none of the bets will go through.

So I can't even use the free bets MGM owed to me, wtf should I do?

I’ve also reached to support to attempt to break them into smaller bets but was told they are unable to because they were system generated.",gimmedawz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/x0a66b/update_mgm_giving_me_the_runaround/,/r/sportsbook/comments/x0a66b/update_mgm_giving_me_the_runaround/,10,2022-08-29 00:07:35,8,,False,0.71,Sportsbook Issue,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wz2isz,"We often hear people say that gambling on sports has caused them to ""lose their appreciation and enjoyment"" of the game itself. Is anyone the exact opposite? For me, I don't think I would care about sports at all if it weren't for sports gambling.","I input sports data into spreadsheets. I'm constantly reading news and updates and listening to football podcasts. I'm trying to understand as much as I can about all these sports, so that I can make money.

I cannot imagine why someone would invest a significant amount of time or energy into following sports if it weren't for gambling. The concept of just being a ""fan"" makes no sense to me, especially when it comes to professional sports. Does anybody seriously just ""love"" baseball so much that they are deeply invested in the outcome of every game in a 162-game season?

sportsbook,wz07e5,I am basically forced to do parlays. Should I just quit?,"The bookies in my country take away ridiculous amount of tax for every bet made. The taxes are levied automatically on every bet and they are around 15% on the payout.

For example if I put 100 euros on 2.00 odds, the payout wont be 200 euros, but around 175, basically pretty difficult to make any profit on single bets. Im forced to make atleast a two leg parlay if I want to double my money.

To make it worse, the odds are usually awful because there is a monopoly in my country where a single bookie owns over 80% of bookies market share and they take insane amount of vig. For every 50/50 bet instead of 1.90/1.90 odds they would set it at 1.80/1.80.

The cherry on top of the cake is that I live in a poor country that has been plagued by bookies, there are physical bookies all over the corners of the city, and so many people are getting addicted and losing a lot of money. Bookie here makes more and more revenue each year.

Also, I cant access any other foreign betting websites and would be legally punished if I do, so that option is also a no go.


Is there any way or worth trying to beat a bookie which takes so much tax or should I just quit?

I'm headed to Vegas around end of October with 3 friends. Avs are playing the Golden Knights, huge college and NFL weekend. NBA has just started. Really looking forward to this trip. 

Does anyone have suggestions on the best way to do Circa? Inside, outside? What are the vibes like outside? Are the lounge chairs going to be enjoyable for many hours? Worth splurging on a table?

If you're new to frisbee betting, [check out this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/oqy68b/ultimate_frisbee_lines/) I made last year.

**Semifinals Lines and Totals - Not my picks, these are just the lines**

- Colorado (-135) vs Chicago (+110) - Total 42.5 - Friday at 5 PM Central
- New York -2 (-225) vs Carolina +2 (+180) - Total 39.5 - Friday at 7:30 PM Central

The winner of each semifinal play in the championship on Saturday at 7 PM Central.

For those interested in watching the games, the two semifinal games can be watched at audl.tv ($10/month paywall) while the championship can be watched on Fox Sports 2.

What are your thoughts and picks? I’ll add mine in the comments below.

sportsbook,wwvxv3,When will LeBron James break the scoring record?,"My book (TAB, Australia) has the following odds:

* A) On the 1st of March 2023 @ Memphis OR LATER = +250 (3.50 odds)
* B) On the 8th of January 2023 @ Sacramento OR EARLIER = +8000 (81.00 odds)
* C) Then you can pick single games anywhere between those dates at various odds - I won't bother listing each individual one

So here is my thinking:

LeBron needs 1325 points to equal Kareem, so **1326 to break the record**.

* We can very likely rule out option B - LeBron would need to average 33.15 points per game and play every single one of the 40 games up to and including this game, to reach 1326.
* I don't like option C, simply because it is a crapshoot trying to pick the exact game.
* I'm wondering whether option A has some value. This would be the Lakers 62nd game of the season. If LeBron played in every single game, he would need to average less than 21.388 points per game, which is highly unlikely. However, this assumes he plays every game. I see several reasons to doubt this.
   * &#x200B;

1. He is getting older and throughout his Lakers tenure has dealt with soft-tissue injuries

* 2) There will likely be an element of load management exercised by the Lakers
* 3) The Lakers could very well suck again which would further disincentivize LeBron from playing every game (i.e. if the season looks like a wasted one, there is no reason to play every game and he could still coast to the record at a later date in the season)
* So let's assume he misses 10 games and the 1st of March is now his 52nd game (instead of his 62nd game) - this would mean we need him to average under 25.5 point per game. This is a steep drop from his 30.3 in 2022, but on par with his 25.0 in 2021. If he misses 15 games, the math becomes even more favourable: 28.2 points per game. And if he has a significant injury that causes him to miss 20+ games, then it's a near lock as he would need under 31.5.

So what are your thoughts on how this plays out? Is there value in taking +250?",ShareMyPicks,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wwvxv3/when_will_lebron_james_break_the_scoring_record/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wwvxv3/when_will_lebron_james_break_the_scoring_record/,12,2022-08-24 21:53:37,24,,False,0.8,NBA 🏀,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wwd0dh,NFL Survivor Week 1,"Haven't seen a thread yet so I thought I'd start the discussion with just a few weeks to go.

I've been using [survivorgrid.com](https://survivorgrid.com) to plan out some weeks, but I'm struggling with a few of those weeks, especially week 1. 

Biggest favorite this week is only 8 points, and with the general uncertainty of it being week 1, it could be a bloodbath right out of the gates.

Good thing is there is no game with a large ownership percentage (I think the highest right now is Ravens over Jets with like 16%-17%) which isn't too high considering most weeks have easily 25-30% ownership on one team.

I actually do like picking the Ravens. After that, probably the Niners over the Bears. Not thrilled with any other options. I guess Philly over Detroit. Want to avoid Titans, Bengals, Broncos.",moggy_doggy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wwd0dh/nfl_survivor_week_1/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wwd0dh/nfl_survivor_week_1/,15,2022-08-24 07:31:24,17,,False,1.0,NFL 🏈,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wvr6j9,How do you guys determine what the chances of a bet hitting are?,"Everyone knows that a bet has value if you expect it to hit more often than the breakeven percentage for that line (for example, the breakeven percent for a -150 bet is 60% - the bet has value if you expect it to hit more frequently than that).

My question is - what methods do you guys use to determine the frequency at which a bet should hit? I can get an expected result, and if my numbers say a team should win by 7 but the line is 4, that's obviously value. But how would you go about quantifying the likelihood of winning?",Some_Champagne,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wvr6j9/how_do_you_guys_determine_what_the_chances_of_a/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wvr6j9/how_do_you_guys_determine_what_the_chances_of_a/,46,2022-08-23 15:05:07,11,,False,0.69,QUESTION ❔,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wvfu1h,Anyone Notice This On The Action Network App?,"So something has been driving me crazy during this MLB season. Occasionally, I'll check out the top ROI bettors for MLB on the Action Network app and it seems all of them are parlaying the ML and RL for either the fave or the dog for either F5 or full game along with the over or under as well (ex. CLE -202 (F5), CLE -220, CLE -1.5 +110). Now, no book would ever actually allow this because of the correlation, so I'm guessing this is shorthand for some kind of hedging system or something.

sportsbook,wvbmg9,"2022, the year of the winning sports bettor, losing tax payer?","With sports betting in full force among a number of new states, what can new sports bettors expect at the end of the tax year. 

Example for sake of the discussion, all on the sportsbook:

FD: Gross winnings: +25k Gross Losses -20k (what form do you get for this 1099, W2G, or does it depend on makeup of the winnings)

DK: Gross winnings: +30k Gross losses -35k (can these losses be used as offset vs FD)

Sugarhouse: Gross winnings: +10K Gross losses: -9.5k (ie <$600 loss often cited as trigger)

What tax forms get triggered in 2022? What triggers them?

Some states dont allow gambling loss deductions (ie CT).

sportsbook,wufn6t,The tour championship (golf),"Hi folks - congrats to everyone who hit cantlay this week. He is the first person to defend the BMW in the events history.

This week brings the final event, the tour championship, with the winner taking home a LIVesque prize of $18 million. It features the top 30 in the fedex cup standing and will not have a cut. If you're not familiar with the event, it uses a staggered start, meaning the players will begin with strokes under par based on their points standing. Some books will offer bets without staggered start as well, since odds will likely be dog shit. The list of players and starting strokes under par is here:

https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/34437651/the-30-players-headed-tour-championship-finale-pga-tour-fedex-cup-playoffs

The event will be played at east lake golf club in Atlanta, same as last year. This course has super narrow fairways, and places an enormous emphasis on accurate driving. That's the key skill to look for this week. For the rest, going to borrow from lct's write up last year.

Course: East Lake Golf Club is a par 70 playing around 7,346 yards

East Lake's fairways play among the tightest on tour and thus driving accuracy will be a premium this week. The rough doesn't play super long so it wouldn't seem like missing the fairway would be a big deal but this is a course where you have to hit your approach shots into the right part of the green to even have a chance of scoring. Looking at past results, Greens in Regulation and Driving Accuracy tend to correlate to the low scores here at East Lake so I'll be looking closely at those stat leaders. Because it can be hard to hit the right parts of these greens out of the rough I'll also be looking at scrambling. This course also tends to feature a lot of uneven lies to ball striking is another stat I'll be looking closely at. There are five par 4s playing between 400-450 with two coming in just under that around 380-385 so I think par 4 scoring 400-450 yds is another stat to consider here. I think that par 4 scoring will cross-over with SG: Approach 125-250 yds as well so I'll be looking at that. There is only 2 par 5s and both are reachable so I think it will be very important to capitalize on them so par 5 scoring will be another stat I'll look at. 

Target Profile: Based on past results here it's all about Tee-To-Green play. The repeat names we see who have performed well here are Xander Schauffele, Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey, and John Rahm and DJ to an extent, all very strong tee-to-green players. Putting doesn't seem to be a necessity here so I won't be looking very closely at that. I'll be looking at Tee-To-Green rankings for my initial target list and from there will be looking at my other key stats to narrow down my list. 

Key Stats: SG: Tee-To-Green, SG: OTT (emphasis on accuracy), SG: Approach (emphasis on 125-150 yds), Scrambling, Ball Striking, Par 4 scoring 400-450 yds, Par 5 scoring.

sportsbook,wt7db7,Increased Caesars comps as a result of sportsbook action?,"Increased Comps from Caesars through sportsbook action?

Have posted this in several groups now across fb and reddit, hoping to get an answer today or start a discussion if anyone is in a similar boat. 

Hoping someone can help clarify recent changes at Caesars with regard to their sportsbook and increased comps i seem to be receiving.  Also my apologies for the long post, wanted to be specific. 

I live near Denver , and go to Blackhawk here and there. I dont have a casino host , admittedly I don't go to the casino as often as I used to due to time constraints, and intermittent car troubles (GAH!).  Over the past year ive been sports betting more. Prior experience (and research) has led me to believe that most casinos don't recognize action on the sportsbook apps in terms of host / comp availability. That is - no comps generated beyond and RC/TC earnings one might accrue, and free nights for ""milestones"". 

Typically I place wagers through Caesars, and about 5 days (+/- 2 days) ago they released a statement that ""online reward credits"" and ""reward credits"" would now be merged into one bankroll. Honestly ? I thought ""this doesn't effect me"" , other than it being a little more user-friendly to redeem now. 

But almost immediately my compd room offers seem to have increased in Las Vegas. And i havent been to LV since april. (Ive gone to blackhawk once or twice, but my offers have stayed the same there). At the bottom of some of the emails, I noticed two phrases I hadn't  before. My 3-night comp offers said contact ""casino marketing executive"" with questions, and another which Included airfare to Laughlin  said contact ""personal casino executive"".

 Ok. Ive never been to Laughlin once. Or had a deal which included airfare. So this one stuck out and inspired me to write this post. 

Finally, my questions : 

1) has anyone noticed increased offers in LV, or places they haven't been, as a result of online casino or sportsbook action? 

2) what do the terms ""casino marketing executive"" and ""personal casino executive"" mean or imply? (Responses on Google were vague at best). 

3) Any other information in terms of eligibility for airfare discounts and comps would be nice.",keasbey1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wt7db7/increased_caesars_comps_as_a_result_of_sportsbook/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wt7db7/increased_caesars_comps_as_a_result_of_sportsbook/,13,2022-08-20 13:39:41,2,,False,0.62,Sportsbooks,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wsnfbj,3-leg parlay “corrected” by book after winning. $1000 win turned to $25 win. Any help?,"My book was running 3 separate Toronto Bluejays boosts yesterday. I put all 3 on a ticket and was surprised to see I could parlay them. 

It hit. 

I turned a $3 bet into a $1000 win. 
Game finished. Win recorded. Winnings deposited into my account.

I woke up this morning and the bet had been corrected / voided. “Bet placed on related outcomes” was the language used. It voided 2 of the 3 legs of the parlay. Turned my $1000 into $25. $1000 had be subtracted from my account. 

I spoke with customer service, they fell back on the T+C saying they reserve the right to correct any bets that should not have gone through. 

Anyone ever dealt with something like this? Any help / advice?

Here are the 3 bets;

Vlad get a HR, Jays win - 8.50

Bichette gets a hit, Vlad RBI, Jays W - 8.00

Over 8.5 runs, Jays W - 4.90

I’m still fairly new to sports gambling so I don’t know all the ins and outs. I obviously knew these lines were all related but I thought the app / algo was smart enough to stop the bet from going through. So when the money hit my account i thought “holy shit, that worked”. I had no idea they could void a bet after it had been paid out.",knife_in_a_gunfight,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wsnfbj/3leg_parlay_corrected_by_book_after_winning_1000/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wsnfbj/3leg_parlay_corrected_by_book_after_winning_1000/,53,2022-08-19 20:01:59,52,,False,0.83,Sportsbook Issue,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wr8osr,When to reach out to Gaming Commission? MGM giving me the runaround.,"Basically title but I will provide timelines:

7/29/22 - Get email from MGM, specifically a VIP rep saying there's a VIP invitation offer for me 40% deposit match up to 15k in deposits, paid out in free bets. Have to rollover in 1 week.

7/30/22 - Deposit 15k

8/5/22 - Rollover complete (finished it 1 day early)

8/6/22 - No free bets applied yet, so I reach out to support and my VIP rep.

8/8/22 - VIP rep replies back saying free bets have been applied to my account, I check and they are there with an expiration date in 1 week so I try find some bets to use it on and 1 hour later the free bets have been removed from my account.

8/10/22 - Reach out again to VIP rep and support asking where my free bets have gone, told by support I would receive some type of email reply in 24-48 hours.

8/15/22 - Reach out to VIP rep and support again asking about this and support says they can see that the bets were loaded in my account and then removed but does not know why and has to escalate to the VIP team to get a clear answer.

8/17/22 - VIP rep finally replies and tells me I'm no longer VIP.

So now, it looks like I am no longer VIP and actually limited now as I can't even get more than $10 on a live bet and I never got to use my free bets.",gimmedawz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wr8osr/when_to_reach_out_to_gaming_commission_mgm_giving/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wr8osr/when_to_reach_out_to_gaming_commission_mgm_giving/,84,2022-08-18 03:25:14,89,,False,0.92,Sportsbook Issue,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wr2o6p,Offshore book with the best player props? Not the prop builder plugin,"So in Tex-ass I don't have access to fanduel or draft kings so I don't have access to their great player prop odds.
Most offshore books I've seen use that prop builder plugin.

That prop builder has awful odds. For example last season Jalen waddle had a prop of over 3.5 catches for - 120 on fanduel.

The same prop on the prop builder was -4.5. If i changed it to -3.5 then the odds would be crazy like -225 or something.

So are there any offshore books that don't use that same prop builder plugin?",waytoodeep03,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wr2o6p/offshore_book_with_the_best_player_props_not_the/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wr2o6p/offshore_book_with_the_best_player_props_not_the/,6,2022-08-17 22:49:29,3,,False,0.67,NCAAF 🏈,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wq96iw,Why would a capper advertise a sportsbook?,"This logic makes absolutely no sense when you think about it. I see these twitter cappers advertising their followers to sign up for a sportsbook. (not a big sports book but some random popup shop). This doesn't make sense.

If the purpose and goal of the capper is to ""kIlL tHe BoOkS"" why would he tell you to sign up for a particular book? 

Also, why then would said sports book contact this capper and ask him to get many of his followers to sign up. If a capper is truly beating the books, then the books are losing money.

So is this a case of the capper intentionally sending out bad picks here and there so the book wins money?",Dml33,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wq96iw/why_would_a_capper_advertise_a_sportsbook/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wq96iw/why_would_a_capper_advertise_a_sportsbook/,33,2022-08-16 23:33:54,0,,False,0.5,Sportsbooks,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893
sportsbook,wq7twb,FanDuel suspended my account for inconsistent activity right after I made a withdrawal for my winnings. Anyone else had this happen to them?,"Update: got my acct unlocked . I had to provide the following 1- Drivers license 2- a statement from PayPal showing my name and the deposit 3- a picture of me holding a sheet of paper with todays date on it. 4- a picture of me doing a handstand naked. ( ok last one was a joke). I had to constantly harass them and I had placed a cpl of bets which I couldn’t cancel cuz my acct was suspended. Those bets I lost, FD can’t do anything about those.

sportsbook,wq1a4q,Betinasia - Orbit Exchange suspension," 

Hi,

I recently received an email with the following text:

""We have to inform you that there is an ongoing investigation from Orbit's side on the following match: Meerbusch Challenger 2022- Milojevic v Moraing (11/08/2022).

Please take note that 545.60 EUR, was deducted from your balance due to this investigation on the mentioned match.""

I placed a bet on this as Moraing was leading 3-1 in the tiebreak in the 1st set of the match. I won the bet with odds of 1,38.

I placed several bets later as well, and suddenly I received the email about the suspension of my account (I can't request for any withdrawal/transfer).

Do anyone have any tips, or anyone encountered this before with Betinasia or Orbit Exchange?

The customer support says this is a regular investigation, and they will inform me as soon as they have any updates. However, it has been 5 days already.

I appreciate all help.",childishboy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wq1a4q/betinasia_orbit_exchange_suspension/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wq1a4q/betinasia_orbit_exchange_suspension/,1,2022-08-16 18:10:49,3,,False,0.8,None,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wp081o,Easily Searchable NFL Betting Database,"Hopefully you guys can help me find a searchable NFL database I found a couple years ago, but now can't seem to locate.  It allowed for a search of all games in t he last 20 years iirc and included whether the game was played on grass or turf, what the spread was etc.  What I am really looking for is the ""turf"" search parameter, but I have been unable to find the dataset again.

I know there is a good dataset at Killersports, and a couple other good excel datasets, but none have an easy to use search dropdown.  I could probably take a few days to learn how to properly search the .CSV files in an advanced matter (or the sql parameters for Killersports) but wanted to see if the reddit community could help me find the dataset I found before!

sportsbook,wosz48,Positive EV betting,"A lot of cappers talk about the magic of positive EV betting.  Basically, as I understand the concept, they look at lines and do some calculation on what the ""true line"" should be, representing extra value in the process.

For example, the book may have a certain bet at +150, but this capper determined the ""true value"" of the bet should be something like +130, therefore giving you an extra perceived sense of value on the bet.

HOWEVER.

How did they come to determine what the ""true value"" of the bet is?  

People like to say ""well this has an implied win percentage of x"" okay, citation needed?  It seems like people are applying arbitrary  logic when it comes to calculating ""true odds"" or something.  It feels like some pseudoscience that many cappers are treating as gospel, as if there's some kind of objective truth in what the odds are and the book has it so wrong that you have to take the bet.  

Can someone explain to me what lends credibility to the idea that the odds the book has is more generous than what the odds *should really* be?  Because all I see is people making assumptions, like yes, if my aunt had a dick she'd be my uncle, but there's no explanation on the increased odds that she should have been my uncle.",reezyreddits,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wosz48/positive_ev_betting/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wosz48/positive_ev_betting/,23,2022-08-15 07:09:04,9,,False,0.63,QUESTION ❔,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wokehz,BMW championship (golf),"Hi folks - since LCT is done for the year, taking it upon myself to get the thread for bmw started.

Congrats to everyone who hit on Willy z, I hope you have fingernails left after that thrilling playoff. 

This year's BMW championship will be played at Wilmington country club in Delaware. The pga tour has never hosted an event in the state of delaware before, and this course has only ever hosted amateurs, so there will not be a lot of course experience (with one exception - keep reading to find out). The field will feature the top 70 in the fedex cup standings and will not have a cut. 

The tournament will be played on Wilmington country club's south course, a long par 71 playing at 7,535 yards. Originally constructed in 1959, the course was reworked last year after a tornado knocked over more than 300 trees.

Last year, Patrick cantlay put on a show on the greens, gaining an absurd 14.6 strokes putting, the most since people started keeping track of that statistic. No one has successfully defended the BMW since it became an event 15 years ago. 

Greens and approaches are Bermudagrass, with bentgrass tees and fairways. According to the clubs director, ""The South Course presents challenging tee shots with fairway bunkers guarding the landing zones, very large putting surfaces divided into multiple sections and flash-faced bunkers.""

I'm going to do a hole by hole analysis tonight to try and think through some key stats to look at. 

The player who was here before? In 2013, this course hosted the Palmer cup, which featured a 20 year old Justin Thomas, who won 3.5 points in the event (Daniel Berger won 3).

I'll also update with picks once odds are posted, likely by late afternoon tomorrow.

Edit: though I've read both on different sites, it looks like the greens are bentgrass not Bermuda.

sportsbook,wo58ym,Vikings Best Overall Record +5000,"Warning, this is a homer pick, but at these odds I see incredible value for this. 

Last year 8 of the 9 Viking’s losses were by 8 points or less, and the one that didn’t the Vikings started their 3rd string QB at Lambeau. 

I believe in the new regime. I think Kirk Cousins will get better, and that the defense filled in some much needed gaps. At least enough that 4 or 5 of those close losses last year could be wins this year. 

Schedule breakdown: 

6 games against NFC North Optimistic Prediction: 5-1 (split with packers, take care of Chicago and Detroit) 

8 games vs NFC and AFC East Optimistic Prediction: 6-2 (lose to Bills, and either of Miami, Dallas or Philly) 

3 games vs Colts, Cardinals, Saints Optimistic prediction: 3-0 

Total: 14-3

I also think looking at the top teams’ schedules and divisions that the team with the best record this year will need only 12 or 13 wins. So with my optimistic prediction, there’s room for a classic Vikings game where they lose to the Lions, Bears, or Commanders. 

Again, not saying this is a lock, but at +5000 I see A LOT of winnable games.",jaiscray,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wo58ym/vikings_best_overall_record_5000/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wo58ym/vikings_best_overall_record_5000/,32,2022-08-14 12:28:24,0,,False,0.25,NFL 🏈,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wnfy4l,Why give out picks without the odds?,"I noticed that a lot of people on here give out or talk about picks without giving the associated odds (for example: ""Mets ML"" instead of ""Mets ML at -180""). I do not understand the value of a pick when the odds are not shown with it. Mets ML could be a good bet at -170 but a terrible one at -200! 

Showing the odds also prevent people tailing after a line move. If someone talks about a Mets ML pick in the morning without mentioning that they got it at -170 and someone later in the day tails when the line moved to Mets ML at -200, it is pretty unfortunate. Those are not the same bets!

sportsbook,wm4rzm,NASCAR - Federated Auto Parts 400 Top Picks & Predictions,"**Blaney to win +1200** \- I am huge on Blaney this week as he is high in the points but yet to get that W. He finished 7th in the spring at Richmond and led the most laps at 128. Blaney has to be in desperation mode to get across the line first if he wants to make the playoffs and the pressure is on. I think we see a 16th winner and see Blaney not have to sweat the last 2 races. His Penske team mates, Logano and Cindric, are already in the playoffs so the focus will be on Blaney all race who badly needs a win in this crazy season!! **Blaney top 5 (to Hedge) +195** 

**Ford winning manufacturer +430** \- Ford has not been up to par this year but at +430 you have to sprinkle this one. Don't bet the farm but take a chance on this one. It hit big last week, there are a few guys in Blaney and Harvick that can do it and for those odds I gotta put a little of last weeks win back on this bet. 

**Harvick over Hamlin +165** \- Hamlin finished first in the spring on this track with Harvick in second so we know these 2 can control this track so why Harvick is +165 is beyond me. Hamlin also has 31 pit road penalties this year. He is his own worst enemy and I'm taking Harvick coming off a huge win last week.

**Christopher Bell Finish outside top 5 -195** \- Truex is the favorite on this track and Gibbs racing will be focused on Truex to secure his playoff spot. With Bell being in 7th in the standing and pretty much has the playoffs sewn up he will barely crack the top 10

sportsbook,wm2jk6,MyBookie is shameful,"MyBookie graded my bet incorrectly as a loss. Tommy Pham 1+ total bases on Tuesday (hit a homerun). -220 bet - wasn’t paid out as of the next morning. No worries, I saw it in my open bets - contacted support to see what the deal was. 
Live support agent said he would settle it (not sure how he’d have the power to do that). He said it would reflect in my balance shortly. By night, I still hadn’t received it. Contacted live support several times, was bounced from department to department.

Finally, phone support agent gives me an answer: he says I bet on Tommy Pham to get EXACTLY 1 total base. Hm. That’s quite a bet at -220! I told him this was clearly a lie and he stated it was what was told to him by the lines department. 

I genuinely don’t think they were trying to scam at first, but now this is just plain ridiculous and it’s clear they’re attempting to avoid payout and scamming. I can’t believe anyone would try to pass a 1+ total base bet as a 1 total base. 

I had not read the horror stories of MyBookie until yesterday and today. It sucks, I had never had a problem with them before.

sportsbook,wlepw4,Betway warning,"They are a bit sneaky. I heard from someone that despite gambling being legal in their country, Betway doesn't accept withdrawls from them as their country is not on their approved list and they were not made aware of this despite depositing money and sending verification documents. For me it was their ""Welcome Bonus"" which I thought existed to lure in more players and encourage them to deposit more since they match your initial deposit. However, some pretty lengthy and hard to find terms and conditions apply and if you do not meet these terms within a week or a month, (depending on where you live), they will take away the bonus and half of your winnings which are automatically associated with the bonus. Even if you meet the terms and conditions in time there're some pretty ludicrous terms and conditions for withdrawing this money too. So I don't recommend taking their ""Welcome Bonus"" and just enjoy using their free daily spins instead.",MrMachi,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wlepw4/betway_warning/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wlepw4/betway_warning/,4,2022-08-11 01:31:11,0,,False,0.5,Sportsbook Issue,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

Eagles +160, Bills -225, Packers -190, Colts -135, Chargers +220, Rams +125, Bucs -250

Bills, bucs and packers should win their divisions by 2-3 games. 
Titans lost too many pieces, colts look the best in that div. 
I think the eagles have a slight edge by gaining AJ brown & cowboys losing coop. 
AFC west is going to be messy, i still see the chiefs winning 10+ games but the broncos and chargers look great on paper. 
49ers/Rams will be close like the afc east, but i'm banking on staffords elbow not being a problem and some trey lance woes.",OverTheWeekend_,https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/wldxrc/nfl_div_winner_parlay/,/r/sportsbook/comments/wldxrc/nfl_div_winner_parlay/,94,2022-08-11 00:53:54,17,,False,0.71,NFL 🏈,2022-09-10 16:14:39.305893

sportsbook,wkjlxk,Let's Talk About Teasers - 2021 Recap,"What's up everyone, if you are unfamiliar with this post or new to the subreddit, one of the things we love to take a look at each week here are the NFL betting lines that follow along with the betting strategies that Stanford Wong outlined for us regarding NFL Teasers. YES if you look below they don’t follow along exactly with how he set it out for us but I have done extensive research into the historical data and outlined the reasoning for how we do it here. 

If you are unfamiliar with Wong Teasers in general you can read the [week 1 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/) from u/blackjack_counter who has since deleted his Reddit. 

Or this [Wong Teaser Basics Article](https://www.sportsgamblingpodcast.com/2022/08/01/degen-university-103-the-wong-teaser/) I wrote over the summer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 6 Point Teasers

Our methodology for playing 6-point teasers is **similar** to Blackjack expert Stanford Wong's strategy:

- Tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, +2½, or +3

- Tease the favorite when the line is -7½, -8, -8½, or -9.

NOTE: The original Wong Criteria do not include +3 or -9 but this is how the post was done previously so we will continue to use them. Over the past 3 years it has only made a difference of about 1.5% to include those.


It is not recommended to tease game totals.


The reasoning behind this methodology is that games are frequently decided by a final margin of 3, 6, or 7. So we play teasers in such a manner that we gain these numbers in the teaser movement.


In the [week 1 post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsbook/comments/iq81x0/nfl_lets_talk_about_teasers/), u/blackjack_counter did a mathematical dive into whether we should be playing games at exactly +3, whether home teams are more reliable than road teams, and whether the total of the game matters.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sweetheart Teasers

 10-point teasers are often called ""sweetheart"" teasers. Over the past three years, underdogs of +1½, +2, +2½ were 139-21 (86.88%).

After looking at a small sample size in 2017-2020, I've decided to track 10-point teasers according to the following methodology:

- For 10-point teasers, tease the underdog when the line is +1½, +2, or +2½;

- Take the favorite at -10 or -10.5

- Do not take sweetheart teasers at +3;

Reasoning: Over the past 3 years, favorites from -10 to -10.5 in a 10 point teaser have a record of 41-4 (91.1%) which is more than enough value to justify adding them to this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 2021 Recap

**These are my opinions**

What’s up guys! Sitting here in July now just patiently awaiting week 1 of the NFL…so I figured I would take some time to break down the 2021 season since I miss it so much. Below you will find the updated statistics with the 2021 season concluded and then be sure to be on the lookout for the Week 1 article probably the week before the season starts.

Overall, great season for Wong teasers in 2021, coming out at right about 90% hit rate for the full season on 6 point teasers. Looking forward to the 2022 season. Be sure to follow me here for each weekly update. Usually they will be on Wednesdays if there is a Thursday night game, or Fridays if there isn’t.

# Historical Wong Teaser Records


*As of 09/13/21, the historical data has been standardized to the s3.sportsdatabase.com SDQL query for each teaser record. This yearly data report is run through that year’s regular season. This data excludes pushes. EX: Year 2018 data is collected from Week 1 to Week 17. 2021 season will be 18 weeks.


|**6 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--| :--|
|2018|+1½ thru +3|59-18|76.62%|
|2019|+1½ thru +3|52-18|74.29%|
|2020|+1½ thru +3|60-16|78.95%|
|2021|+1½ thru +3|67-17|79.76%|
|2018|-7½ thru -9|18-3|85.71%|
|2019|-7½ thru -9|13-4|76.47%|
|2020|-7½ thru -9|25-3|89.29%|
|2021|-7½ thru -9|24-5|82.76%|



|**10 pt Teaser**|**Year**|**Spread**|**Record**|**Win %**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2018|+1½ thru +2½|35-3|92.1%|
|2019|+1½ thru +2½|35-5|87.5%|
|2020|+1½ thru +2½|34-6|85%|
|2021|+1½ thru +2½|36-3|92.3%|
|2018|-10 thru -10 ½|10-1|90.91%|
|2019|-10 thru -10 ½|10-3|76.92%|
|2020|-10 thru -10 ½|8-0|100%|
|2021|-10 thru -10 ½|13-0|100%|


Assuming a -120 payout for 2-team teasers, we must demonstrate better than 73.9% probability on each leg to show we have breakeven-or-better EV. **For a -130 payout on 3-team sweethearts, that threshold is 82.7%.** These are specifically for my book so yours may differ.

|**Teams**|**Odds**|**Implied Odds per Leg**|**Threshold**|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|2|-120|-282|73.8%|
|3|+150|-280|73.7%|
|4|+235|-283|73.9%|
|5|+350|-285|74%|
|6|+550|-273|73.2%|


NEW CHART – Overall Weekly Records for 6pt teasers over the last 4 years (Week 18 is only 2021)

|**Week**|**Record**|**Win %**|
--|:--|:--|
|1|22-4|84.62%|
|2|17-3|85%|
|3|26-2|92.86%

|16|23-4|85.19%|
|17|9-7|56.25%|
|18|2-0|100%|

This shows that, historically, week 3 and 8 are the best weeks to bet these teasers for some reason.

# Regarding game totals < 49

The games with a total of 49 or less got brought up originally by u/blackjack_counter. In his week 1 post, he put:
>Do totals matter? Another word of advice that some Wong bettors give is to only play games with low totals. The idea certainly makes sense: points are harder to come by in a low-scoring game, so the 6-point tease is worth more. But what does the data say about this in the last three years?


From 2018-2021, here are the statistics including playoffs:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|234-65|78.26%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|177-50|77.97%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|36-13|73.47%|


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|76-15|83.52%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|60-11|84.5%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|12-1|92.3%|


If you wanted to look at only home favorites (Wong's original criteria is home favorites):


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|53-12|81.25%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|43-9|82.7%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|9-1|90%|


Although, u/blackjack_counter proved in his week 1 post that only betting home favorites for Wong teasers proved not to be necessarily a great bet.


Here is the results for 2021:


|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Underdogs +1½, +2, +2½, +3|67-17|79.76%|
|Total 49 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|51-11|82.26%|
|Total 42 or under (dog +1½ thru +3)|10-5|66.67%|



|Bet|Record|Win %|
:--|:--|:--|
|Favorites -7½, -8, -8½, -9|24-5|82.76%|
|Total 49 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|21-3|87.5%|
|Total 42 or under (fav -7½ thru -9)|5-1|83.33%|
